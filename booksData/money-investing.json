Graham's philosophy of \"value investing\" -- which shields investors from substantial error and teaches them to develop long-term strategies -- has made The Intelligent Investor the stock market bible ever since its original publication in 1949.Over the years, market developments have proven the wisdom of Graham's strategies. While preserving the integrity of Graham's original text, this revised edition includes updated commentary by noted financial journalist Jason Zweig, whose perspective incorporates the realities of today's market, draws parallels between Graham's examples and today's financial headlines, and gives readers a more thorough understanding of how to apply Graham's principles.Vital and indispensable, this HarperBusiness Essentials edition of The Intelligent Investor is the most important book you will ever read on how to reach your financial goals.",

            "description": "It's not always about what you know when it comes to money. It's all about how you act. Even for the most intelligent people, behavior is difficult to teach. Money is often taught as a math-based field, where statistics and formulae tell us exactly what to do in terms of investing, personal finance, and company decisions. People don't make financial decisions on spreadsheets in the real world. Personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and unusual incentives all mixed together around the dinner table or in a conference room. Morgan Housel, an award-winning author, provides 19 short stories in The Psychology of Money that explore the unique ways individuals think about money and show you how to make sense of one of life's most crucial topics.",

Once you learn and apply the simple, basic techniques revealed here, you will have mastered the secret of true and lasting success.Money and material things are essential for freedom of body and mind, but there are some who will feel that the greatest of all riches can be evaluated only in terms of lasting friendships, loving family relationships, understanding between business associates, and introspective harmony which brings one true peace of mind! All who read, understand, and apply this philosophy will be better prepared to attract and enjoy these spiritual values.BE PREPARED! When you expose yourself to the influence of this philosophy, you may experience a CHANGED LIFE which can help you negotiate your way through life with harmony and understanding and prepare you for the accumulation of abundant material riches.",

Over a decade, Low, with the aid of Goldman Sachs and others, siphoned billions of dollars from an investment fund--right under the nose of global financial industry watchdogs. Low used the money to finance elections, purchase luxury real estate, throw champagne-drenched parties, and even to finance Hollywood films like The Wolf of Wall Street.By early 2019, with his yacht and private jet reportedly seized by authorities and facing criminal charges in Malaysia and in the United States, Low had become an international fugitive, even as the U.S. Department of Justice continued its investigation.BILLION DOLLAR WHALE has joined the ranks of Liar's Poker, Den of Thieves, and Bad Blood as a classic harrowing parable of hubris and greed in the financial world.",

            "description": "With over a million copies sold, Economics in One Lesson is an essential guide to the basics of economic theory. A fundamental influence on modern libertarianism, Hazlitt defends capitalism and the free market from economic myths that persist to this day.Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the \u201cAustrian School,\u201d which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication.  Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy.Economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt\u2019s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong \u2014 and strongly reasoned \u2014 anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.",

His awesome investment record has made him a cult figure popularly known for his seeming contradictions: a billionaire who has a modest lifestyle, a phenomenally successful investor who eschews the revolving-door trading of modern Wall Street, a brilliant dealmaker who cultivates a homespun aura.Journalist Roger Lowenstein draws on three years of unprecedented access to Buffett\u2019s family, friends, and colleagues to provide the first definitive, inside account of the life and career of this American original. Buffett explains Buffett\u2019s investment strategy\u2014a long-term philosophy grounded in buying stock in companies that are undervalued on the market and hanging on until their worth invariably surfaces\u2014and shows how it is a reflection of his inner self.",

            "description": "With the stock market breaking records almost daily, leaving longtime market analysts shaking their heads and revising their forecasts, a study of the concept of risk seems quite timely. Peter Bernstein has written a comprehensive history of man's efforts to understand risk and probability, beginning with early gamblers in ancient Greece, continuing through the 17th-century French mathematicians Pascal and Fermat and up to modern chaos theory. Along the way he demonstrates that understanding risk underlies everything from game theory to bridge-building to winemaking.",

            "description": "Here is THE book recounting the life and times of one of the most respected men in the world, Warren Buffett. The legendary Omaha investor has never written a memoir, but now he has allowed one writer, Alice Schroeder, unprecedented access to explore directly with him and with those closest to him his work, opinions, struggles, triumphs, follies, and wisdom. The result is the personally revealing and complete biography of the man known everywhere as \u201cThe Oracle of Omaha.\u201dAlthough the media track him constantly, Buffett himself has never told his full life story. His reality is private, especially by celebrity standards. Indeed, while the homespun persona that the public sees is true as far as it goes, it goes only so far. Warren Buffett is an array of paradoxes. He set out to prove that nice guys can finish first. Over the years he treated his investors as partners, acted as their steward, and championed honesty as an investor, CEO, board member, essayist, and speaker. At the same time he became the world\u2019s richest man, all from the modest Omaha headquarters of his company Berkshire Hathaway. None of this fits the term \u201csimple.\u201dWhen Alice Schroeder met Warren Buffett she was an insurance industry analyst and a gifted writer known for her keen perception and business acumen. Her writings on finance impressed him, and as she came to know him she realized that while much had been written on the subject of his investing style, no one had moved beyond that to explore his larger philosophy, which is bound up in a complex personality and the details of his life. Out of this came his decision to cooperate with her on the book about himself that he would never write.Never before has Buffett spent countless hours responding to a writer\u2019s questions, talking, giving complete access to his wife, children, friends, and business associates\u2014opening his files, recalling his childhood. It was an act of courage, as The Snowball makes immensely clear. Being human, his own life, like most lives, has been a mix of strengths and frailties. Yet notable though his wealth may be, Buffett\u2019s legacy will not be his ranking on the scorecard of wealth; it will be his principles and ideas that have enriched people\u2019s lives. This book tells you why Warren Buffett is the most fascinating American success story of our time.",

BuffettFirst published in 1934, Security Analysis is one of the most influential financial books ever written. Selling more than one million copies through five editions, it has provided generations of investors with the timeless value investing philosophy and techniques of Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd.As relevant today as when they first appeared nearly 75 years ago, the teachings of Benjamin Graham, \u201cthe father of value investing,\u201d have withstood the test of time across a wide diversity of market conditions, countries, and asset classes.This new sixth edition, based on the classic 1940 version, is enhanced with 200 additional pages of commentary from some of today\u2019s leading Wall Street money managers. These masters of value investing explain why the principles and techniques of Graham and Dodd are still highly relevant even in today\u2019s vastly different markets. Featuring a foreword by Warren E. Buffett (in which he reveals that he has read the 1940 masterwork \u201cat least four times\u201d), this new edition of Security Analysis will reacquaint you with the foundations of value investing\u2015more relevant than ever in the tumultuous 21st century markets.",

            "description": "In May of 2011, Columbia Business School Publishing released Howard Marks' \"The Most Important Thing,\" a book that distilled the wisdom of Marks' celebrated client memos into a single volume, making his time-tested investing philosophy available to general readers for the first time. The book was greeted with wide acclaim from investors--professional, casual, aspiring, and armchair alike--and became a business bestseller.Now, Columbia Business School Publishing is proud to announce an innovative digital edition that allows you to read Marks' words alongside comments, insights and counterpoints from four other renowned investors and investment educators: Christopher Davis, Joel Greenblatt, Paul Johnson and Seth Klarman. See what these investors think of such concepts as \"second-level thinking,\" the price/value relationship, patient opportunism, and defensive investing. There are also annotations from Howard Marks himself, highlighting some of the themes that run throughout the book, along with a previously unpublished bonus chapter on the importance of reasonable expectations. This edition features a foreword from Bruce Greenwald.Whether you've already read \"The Most Important Thing\" cover to cover or are new to the book, The Most Important Thing Illuminated will give you an unprecedented look into how America's top investors make decisions and achieve financial success.",

            "description": "We battle for the old when the fresh new is unimaginable. That is where we are now in terms of governments, politics, and most of the physical world. But maybe we can alter it.This book offers the notion of the network state: a country that can be started from a computer, a state that recruits like a startup, a nation developed from the internet rather than disturbed by it.The basic idea behind the network state is to create a digital community and arrange it to crowdfund physical territory. But that area is not concentrated in one location; rather, it is distributed globally, entirely decentralised, and linked together through the internet for a common goal, much like Google's headquarters or Bitcoin's miners. And, because every person has opted in, it is a model for 100 percent democracy rather than the 51 percent minimum level of consent established by democracies.Of course, there are other questions that must be addressed in order to construct something of this magnitude. How does a network state function on a social, technological, logistical, legal, physical, and financial level? How could such a thing be possible?That\u2019s why you should read this book.",

            "description": "Charlie Munger, Berkshire Hathaway's visionary vice chairman and Warren Buffett's indispensable financial partner, has outperformed market indexes again and again, and he believes any investor can do the same. His notion of \"elementary, worldly wisdom\"--a set of interdisciplinary mental models involving economics, business, psychology, ethics, and management--allows him to keep his emotions out of his investments and avoid the common pitfalls of bad judgment.Munger's system has steered his investments for forty years and has guided generations of successful investors. This book presents the essential steps of Munger's investing strategy, condensed here for the first time from interviews, speeches, writings, and shareholder letters, and paired with commentary from fund managers, value investors, and business-case historians. Derived from Ben Graham's value-investing system, Munger's approach is straightforward enough that ordinary investors can apply it to their portfolios. This book is not simply about investing. It is about cultivating mental models for your whole life, but especially for your investments.",

            "description": "Get the inside scoop on what venture capitalists want to see in your startup as you hit the fundraising trail.This is the highly anticipated third edition of the best-selling book which has become the definitive resource for understanding venture capital fundraising. Whether you are an entrepreneur, lawyer, student or just have an interest in the venture capital ecosystem, Venture Deals is for you. The book dives deeply into how deals are constructed, why certain terms matter (and others don\u2019t), and more importantly, what motivates venture capitalists to propose certain outcomes. You\u2019ll see the process of negotiating from the eyes of two seasoned venture capitalists who have over 40 years of investing experience as VCs, LPs, angels, and founders. They will teach you how to develop a fundraising strategy that will be a win for all parties involved.This book is designed to bring transparency to the venture capital funding process and includes such topics as:How to raise money;What terms matter and which ones don\u2019t;How to negotiate a fair deal for everyone;What makes venture capitalists tick, including how they are compensated and motivated;How companies are valued by venture capitalists;How all current structures of funding work, including convertible debt, crowdfunding, pre-sales and other non-traditional methods;How these particular issues change through different stages of financing (seed, early, mid and late); andHow to avoid business and legal pitfalls that many entrepreneurs make.And as in the previous editions, this book isn\u2019t just a one-sided opinion from venture capitalists, but also has helpful commentary throughout from a veteran CEO who has raised many rounds of financing from many different investors.If you are ready to learn all the secrets and ins and outs of fundraising, Venture Deals is an essential read.",

            "description": "The #1 New York Times bestseller: a brilliant account\u2015character-rich and darkly humorous\u2015of how the U.S. economy was driven over the cliff.When the crash of the U. S. stock market became public knowledge in the fall of 2008, it was already old news. The real crash, the silent crash, had taken place over the previous year, in bizarre feeder markets where the sun doesn\u2019t shine, and the SEC doesn\u2019t dare, or bother, to tread: the bond and real estate derivative markets where geeks invent impenetrable securities to profit from the misery of lower- and middle-class Americans who can\u2019t pay their debts. The smart people who understood what was or might be happening were paralyzed by hope and fear; in any case, they weren\u2019t talking.The crucial question is this: Who understood the risk inherent in the assumption of ever-rising real estate prices, a risk compounded daily by the creation of those arcane, artificial securities loosely based on piles of doubtful mortgages? Michael Lewis turns the inquiry on its head to create a fresh, character-driven narrative brimming with indignation and dark humor, a fitting sequel to his #1 best-selling Liar\u2019s Poker. Who got it right? he asks. Who saw the real estate market for the black hole it would become, and eventually made billions of dollars from that perception? And what qualities of character made those few persist when their peers and colleagues dismissed them as Chicken Littles? Out of this handful of unlikely\u2015really unlikely\u2015heroes, Lewis fashions a story as compelling and unusual as any of his earlier bestsellers, proving yet again that he is the finest and funniest chronicler of our times.",

            "description": "\"There are a few investment managers, of course, who are very good - though in the short run, it's difficult to determine whether a great record is due to luck or talent. Most advisors, however, are far better at generating high fees than they are at generating high returns. In truth, their core competence is salesmanship. Rather than listen to their siren songs, investors - large and small - should instead read Jack Bogle's The Little Book of Common Sense Investing.\" - Warren Buffett, Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, 2014 Annual Shareholder Letter.Investing is all about common sense. Owning a diversified portfolio of stocks and holding it for the long term is a winner's game. Trying to beat the stock market is theoretically a zero-sum game (for every winner, there must be a loser), but after the substantial costs of investing are deducted, it becomes a loser's game. Common sense tells us--and history confirms--that the simplest and most efficient investment strategy is to buy and hold all of the nation's publicly held businesses at very low cost. The classic index fund that owns this market portfolio is the only investment that guarantees you with your fair share of stock market returns. To learn how to make index investing work for you, there's no better mentor than legendary mutual fund industry veteran John C. Bogle. Over the course of his long career, Bogle--founder of the Vanguard Group and creator of the world's first index mutual fund--has relied primarily on index investing to help Vanguard's clients build substantial wealth. Now, with The Little Book of Common Sense Investing, he wants to help you do the same.Filled with in-depth insights and practical advice, The Little Book of Common Sense Investing will show you how to incorporate this proven investment strategy into your portfolio. It will also change the very way you think about investing. Successful investing is not easy. (It requires discipline and patience.) But it is simple. For it's all about common sense.With The Little Book of Common Sense Investing as your guide, you'll discover how to make investing a winner's game:Why business reality--dividend yields and earnings growth--is more important than market expectations How to overcome the powerful impact of investment costs, taxes, and inflation How the magic of compounding returns is overwhelmed by the tyranny of compounding costs What expert investors and brilliant academics--from Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham to Paul Samuelson and Burton Malkiel--have to say about index investing And much more You'll also find warnings about investment fads and fashions, including the recent stampede into exchange-traded funds and the rise of indexing gimmickry. The real formula for investment success is to own the entire market, while significantly minimizing the costs of financial intermediation. That's what index investing is all about. And that's what this book is all about.",

            "description": "\u201cA riveting account that reaches beyond the market landscape to say something universal about risk and triumph, about hubris and failure.\u201d\u2014The New York TimesIn this business classic\u2014now with a new Afterword in which the author draws parallels to the recent financial crisis\u2014Roger Lowenstein captures the gripping roller-coaster ride of Long-Term Capital Management. Drawing on confidential internal memos and interviews with dozens of key players, Lowenstein explains not just how the fund made and lost its money but also how the personalities of Long-Term\u2019s partners, the arrogance of their mathematical certainties, and the culture of Wall Street itself contributed to both their rise and their fall.When it was founded in 1993, Long-Term was hailed as the most impressive hedge fund in history. But after four years in which the firm dazzled Wall Street as a $100 billion moneymaking juggernaut, it suddenly suffered catastrophic losses that jeopardized not only the biggest banks on Wall Street but the stability of the financial system itself. The dramatic story of Long-Term\u2019s fall is now a chilling harbinger of the crisis that would strike all of Wall Street, from Lehman Brothers to AIG, a decade later. In his new Afterword, Lowenstein shows that LTCM\u2019s implosion should be seen not as a one-off drama but as a template for market meltdowns in an age of instability\u2014and as a wake-up call that Wall Street and government alike tragically ignored.",

            "description": "\"Experts\" are rarely the source of new ideas. Elon Musk was not a \"electric car guy\" prior to founding Tesla. A prominent tech VC once told Sebastian Mallaby that when it comes to implausible inventions, the future cannot be foretold; it can only be discovered. Most attempts at discovery fail due to the nature of the venture-capital game, but a few few succeed on such a large scale that they more than compensate for everything else. That extraordinary success-to-failure ratio is the power law that drives the venture capital industry, all of Silicon Valley, the broader tech sector, and, by extension, the globe.In The Power Law, Sebastian Mallaby has parlayed unprecedented access to the most celebrated venture capitalists of all time\u2014key figures at Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Accel, Benchmark, and Andreessen Horowitz, as well as Chinese partnerships like Qiming and Capital Today\u2014into a riveting blend of storytelling and analysis that unravels the history of tech incubation, first in Silicon Valley and then globally. We hear the unvarnished truth, often for the first time, about some of the Valley's most iconic triumphs and infamous failures, from the comedy of errors at Apple's inception to the avalanche of venture capital that nurtured hubris at WeWork and Uber.The continuous pursuit of grand slams by venture capitalists breeds an infatuation with the notion of the lone entrepreneur-genius, and firms viewed as potential \"unicorns\" are granted dizzying levels of power, often with devastating repercussions. On a broader level, the necessity to make large bets on untested talent promotes bias, with women and minorities remaining underrepresented. This has ramifications beyond social justice: as Mallaby points out, China's domestic VC industry, having learnt at the Valley's feet, is expanding, with more women VC luminaries than America has ever had. Nonetheless, Silicon Valley venture capital remains the world's leading incubator of business innovation\u2014it is not so much where ideas originate from as it is where they go to become the products and businesses that shape the future. The Power Law lets us think about our own destiny through the perspective of VCs by immersing us so fully in their game.",

Each is an example of how an iconic company was defined by a particular moment of fame or notoriety; these notable and fascinating accounts are as relevant today to understanding the intricacies of corporate life as they were when the events happened.Stories about Wall Street are infused with drama and adventure and reveal the machinations and volatile nature of the world of finance. Longtime New Yorker contributor John Brooks\u2019s insightful reportage is so full of personality and critical detail that whether he is looking at the astounding market crash of 1962, the collapse of a well-known brokerage firm, or the bold attempt by American bankers to save the British pound, one gets the sense that history repeats itself.Five additional stories on equally fascinating subjects round out this wonderful collection that will both entertain and inform readers . . . Business Adventures is truly financial journalism at its liveliest and best.",

We may resent the plutocrats of Wall Street but, as Ferguson argues, the evolution of finance has rivaled the importance of any technological innovation in the rise of civilization. Indeed, to study the ascent and descent of money is to study the rise and fall of Western power itself.",

According to the author, the key to making wise, lucrative investments is knowing ourselves. In witty, easily accessible language, he shares pithy insights about the role of intuition and the psychology of guilt, arguing that there is no substitute for information. Smith\u2019s Irregular Rules shatter common myths and misconceptions, revealing why nothing works all the time and illustrating how greed and fear fuel the market.Readers will learn about the safest types of investing, the key to following market trends, and how to capitalize growth, gleaning tips on stock movers, winners and losers, and much more. Peppered with entertaining and prescient anecdotes, The Money Game analyzes who makes the really big money and explores the meaning of our desire to become rich. From selling short and buying long to Wall Street\u2019s crowd mentality, from what constitutes a random walk to why timing is everything, this is the definitive portrait of the Street, then and now.",

            "description": "Investors are all too often lured by the prospect of instant millions and fall prey to the many fads of Wall Street. The myriad approaches they adopt offer little or no real prospect for long-term success and invariably run the risk of considerable economic loss - they resemble speculation or outright gambling, not a coherent investment program. But value investing - the strategy of investing in securities trading at an appreciable discount from underlying value - has a long history - has a long history of delivering excellent investment results with limited downside risk.Taking its title from Benjamin Graham's often-repeated admonition to invest always with a margin of safety, Klarman's 'Margin of Safety' explains the philosophy of value investing, and perhaps more importantly, the logic behind it, demonstrating why it succeeds while other approaches fail. The blueprint that Klarman offers, if carefully followed, offers the investor the strong possibility of investment success with limited risk.'Margin of Safety' shows you not just how to invest but how to think deeply about investing - to understand the rationale behind the rules to appreciate why they work when they work, and why they don't when they don't.",

Today, Munger is one of America\u2019s most successful investors, the Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, and Warren Buffett\u2019s business partner for almost forty years. Buffett says \u201cBerkshire has been built to Charlie\u2019s blueprint. My role has been that of general contractor.\u201d Munger is an intelligent, opinionated business man whose ideas can teach professional and amateur investors how to be successful in finance and life.Like The Tao of Warren Buffett and The Tao of Te Ching, The Tao of Charlie Munger is a compendium of pithy quotes including, \u201cKnowing what you don\u2019t know is more useful than being brilliant\u201d and \u201cIn my whole life, I have known no wise people who didn\u2019t read all the time\u2014none, zero.\u201d This collection, culled from interviews, speeches, and questions and answers at the Berkshire Hathaway and Wesco annual meetings, offers insights into Munger\u2019s amazing financial success and life philosophies. Described by Business Insider as \u201csharp in his wit and investing wisdom,\u201d Charlie Munger\u2019s investment tips, business philosophy, and rules for living are as unique as his life story; intelligent as he clearly is; and as successful as he has been.",

            "description": "Every economics textbook says the same thing: Money was invented to replace onerous and complicated barter systems\u2014to relieve ancient people from having to haul their goods to market. The problem with this version of history? There\u2019s not a shred of evidence to support it.Here anthropologist David Graeber presents a stunning reversal of conventional wisdom: he shows that before there was money, there was debt. For more than 5,000 years, since the beginnings of the first agrarian empires, humans have used elaborate credit systems to buy and sell goods\u2014that is, long before the invention of coins or cash. It is in this era, Graeber argues, that we also first encounter a society divided into debtors and creditors.Graeber shows that arguments about debt and debt forgiveness have been at the center of political debates from Italy to China, as well as sparking innumerable insurrections. He also brilliantly demonstrates that the language of the ancient works of law and religion (words like \u201cguilt,\u201d \u201csin,\u201d and \u201credemption\u201d) derive in large part from ancient debates about debt, and shape even our most basic ideas of right and wrong. We are still fighting these battles today without knowing it.Debt: The First 5,000 Years is a fascinating chronicle of this little known history\u2014as well as how it has defined human history, and what it means for the credit crisis of the present day and the future of our economy.",

            "description": "Warren Buffett is the most famous investor of all time and one of today\u2019s most admired business leaders. He became a billionaire and investment sage by looking at companies as businesses rather than prices on a stock screen. The first two editions of The Warren Buffett Way gave investors their first in-depth look at the innovative investment and business strategies behind Buffett\u2019s spectacular success. The new edition updates readers on the latest investments by Buffett. And, more importantly, it draws on the new field of behavioral finance to explain how investors can overcome the common obstacles that prevent them from investing like Buffett. New material includes: How to think like a long-term investor \u2013 just like BuffettWhy \u201closs aversion\u201d, the tendency of most investors to overweight the pain of losing money, is one of the biggest obstacles that investors must overcome.Why behaving rationally in the face of the ups and downs of the market has been the key to Buffett\u2019s investing successAnalysis of Buffett\u2019s recent acquisition of H.J. Heinz and his investment in IBM stock The greatest challenge to emulating Buffett is not in the selection of the right stocks, Hagstrom writes, but in having the fortitude to stick with sound investments in the face of economic and market uncertainty. The new edition explains the psychological foundations of Buffett\u2019s approach, thus giving readers the best roadmap yet for mastering both the principles and behaviors that have made Buffett the greatest investor of our generation.",

            "description": "Howard Marks, the chairman and cofounder of Oaktree Capital Management, is renowned for his insightful assessments of market opportunity and risk. After four decades spent ascending to the top of the investment management profession, he is today sought out by the world's leading value investors, and his client memos brim with insightful commentary and a time-tested, fundamental philosophy. Now for the first time, all readers can benefit from Marks's wisdom, concentrated into a single volume that speaks to both the amateur and seasoned investor.Informed by a lifetime of experience and study, The Most Important Thing explains the keys to successful investment and the pitfalls that can destroy capital or ruin a career. Utilizing passages from his memos to illustrate his ideas, Marks teaches by example, detailing the development of an investment philosophy that fully acknowledges the complexities of investing and the perils of the financial world. Brilliantly applying insight to today's volatile markets, Marks offers a volume that is part memoir, part creed, with a number of broad takeaways.Marks expounds on such concepts as \"second-level thinking,\" the price/value relationship, patient opportunism, and defensive investing. Frankly and honestly assessing his own decisions--and occasional missteps--he provides valuable lessons for critical thinking, risk assessment, and investment strategy. Encouraging investors to be \"contrarian,\" Marks wisely judges market cycles and achieves returns through aggressive yet measured action. Which element is the most essential? Successful investing requires thoughtful attention to many separate aspects, and each of Marks's subjects proves to be the most important thing.\"This is that rarity, a useful book.\"--Warren Buffett",

            "description": "Throughout history, rich and poor countries alike have been lending, borrowing, crashing--and recovering--their way through an extraordinary range of financial crises. Each time, the experts have chimed, \"this time is different\"--claiming that the old rules of valuation no longer apply and that the new situation bears little similarity to past disasters. With this breakthrough study, leading economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff definitively prove them wrong. Covering sixty-six countries across five continents, This Time Is Different presents a comprehensive look at the varieties of financial crises, and guides us through eight astonishing centuries of government defaults, banking panics, and inflationary spikes--from medieval currency debasements to today's subprime catastrophe. Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, leading economists whose work has been influential in the policy debate concerning the current financial crisis, provocatively argue that financial combustions are universal rites of passage for emerging and established market nations. The authors draw important lessons from history to show us how much--or how little--we have learned.Using clear, sharp analysis and comprehensive data, Reinhart and Rogoff document that financial fallouts occur in clusters and strike with surprisingly consistent frequency, duration, and ferocity. They examine the patterns of currency crashes, high and hyperinflation, and government defaults on international and domestic debts--as well as the cycles in housing and equity prices, capital flows, unemployment, and government revenues around these crises. While countries do weather their financial storms, Reinhart and Rogoff prove that short memories make it all too easy for crises to recur.An important book that will affect policy discussions for a long time to come, This Time Is Different exposes centuries of financial missteps.",

            "description": "Mathematical superstar and inventor of fractal geometry, Benoit Mandelbrot, has spent the past forty years studying the underlying mathematics of space and natural patterns. What many of his followers don't realize is that he has also been watching patterns of market change. In The (Mis)Behavior of Markets, Mandelbrot joins with science journalist and former Wall Street Journal editor Richard L. Hudson to reveal what a fractal view of the world of finance looks like. The result is a revolutionary reevaluation of the standard tools and models of modern financial theory. Markets, we learn, are far riskier than we have wanted to believe.From the gyrations of IBM's stock price and the Dow, to cotton trading, and the dollar-Euro exchange rate--Mandelbrot shows that the world of finance can be understood in more accurate, and volatile, terms than the tired theories of yesteryear.The ability to simplify the complex has made Mandelbrot one of the century's most influential mathematicians. With The (Mis)Behavior of Markets, he puts the tools of higher mathematics into the hands of every person involved with markets, from financial analysts to economists to 401(k) holders. Markets will never be seen as \"safe bets\" again.",

            "description": "In 1982, the Dow hovered below 1000. Then, the market rose and rapidly gained speed until it peaked above 11,000. Noted journalist and financial reporter Maggie Mahar has written the first book on the remarkable bull market that began in 1982 and ended just in the early 2000s. For almost two decades, a colorful cast of characters such as Abby Joseph Cohen, Mary Meeker, Henry Blodget, and Alan Greenspan came to dominate the market news.This inside look at that 17-year cycle of growth, built upon interviews and unparalleled access to the most important analysts, market observers, and fund managers who eagerly tell the tales of excesses, presents the period with a historical perspective and explains what really happened and why.",

            "description": "A revealing look at Wall Street, the financial media, and financial regulators by David Einhorn, the President of Greenlight CapitalCould 2008's credit crisis have been minimized or even avoided? In 2002, David Einhorn-one of the country's top investors-was asked at a charity investment conference to share his best investment advice. Short sell Allied Capital. At the time, Allied was a leader in the private financing industry. Einhorn claimed Allied was using questionable accounting practices to prop itself up. Sound familiar? At the time of the original version of \"Fooling Some of the People All of the Time: A Long Short Story\" the outcome of his advice was unknown.Now, the story is complete and we know Einhorn was right. In 2008, Einhorn advised the same conference to short sell Lehman Brothers. And had the market been more open to his warnings, yes, the market meltdown might have been avoided, or at least minimized.\"Fooling Some of the People All of the Time\" is an important call for effective government regulation, free speech, and fair play.",

You know how it goes-go to school, get a good job, save 10 percent of your paycheck, buy a used car, cancel the movie channels, quit drinking expensive Starbucks mocha lattes, save and penny-pinch your life away, trust your life-savings to the stock market, and one day you can retire rich. The mainstream financial gurus have sold you blindly down the river. For those who don't want a lifetime subscription to \"settle for less,\" and a slight chance of elderly riches, there is an expressway to extraordinary wealth that can burn a trail to financial independence faster than any road out there. Demand the Fastlane, an alternative road to wealth that actually ignites dreams and creates millionaires young, not old. Hit the Fastlane, crack the code to wealth, and find out how to live rich for a lifetime.",

The Greeks intended to transform their nation into a pi\u00f1ata loaded with money and let as many people as possible smack it. The Germans desired to become even more German, while the Irish desired to become less Irish.The American reader is lulled into a comfortable complacency by Michael Lewis' exploration of bubbles outside our boundaries, which is beautifully, cruelly amusing.

Here is how I did it and what I learned along the way.' So writes Felix Dennis, who believes that almost anyone of reasonable intelligence can become rich, given sufficient motivation and application.\u200dHow To Get Rich is a distillation of his business wisdom. Primarily concerned with the step-by-step creation of wealth, it ruthlessly dissects the business failures and financial triumphs of 'a South London lad who became rich virtually by accident'. Part manual, part memoir, part primer, this book is a template for those who are willing to stare down failure and transform their lives.Canny, infuriating, cynical and generous by turns, How To Get Rich is an invaluable guide to 'the surprisingly simple art of collecting money which already has your name on it'.",

As society stands on the cusp of unprecedented change, Jerry Kaplan unpacks the latest advances in robotics, machine learning, and perception powering systems that rival or exceed human capabilities. Driverless cars, robotic helpers, and intelligent agents that promote our interests have the potential to usher in a new age of affluence and leisure \u2014 but as Kaplan warns, the transition may be protracted and brutal unless we address the two great scourges of the modern developed world: volatile labor markets and income inequality. He proposes innovative, free-market adjustments to our economic system and social policies to avoid an extended period of social turmoil. His timely and accessible analysis of the promise and perils of artificial intelligence is a must-read for business leaders and policy makers on both sides of the aisle.",

            "description": "Merrill Lynch Wealth Management's Chief Investment Officer explains why goals, not markets, should be the primary focus of your investing plan\u2014and provides a practical, creative approach for aligning your goals with your investment strategy.Today, we all have the responsibility of sensible investing, but far too many of us are focused with the wrong goals: maximizing returns at any costs, finding the next big fund manager, or outperforming \"the market.\" Regrettably, traditional portfolio theory and the big debates in finance have only provided investors only partial answers. What's needed, according to Ashvin B. Chhabra, is a framework that shifts investment strategy's focus away from portfolios and markets and toward individuals and the goals that really matter: things like avoiding financial crises, paying for education or retirement, and funding philanthropy and entrepreneurship.Rather than reacting to the whims of the financial markets, the Aspirational Investor is a practical, innovative approach to wealth management based on key goals and careful risk allocation. Chhabra introduces his \"Wealth Allocation Framework,\" which accommodates the three seemingly incompatible goals that must underpin every sound wealth management plan: financial security in the face of known and unknown risks, maintaining current living standards over time despite inflation, and pursuing aspirational wealth creation goals.By simplifying our understanding of key asset classes and laying out a concise roadmap for identifying, prioritizing, and quantifying financial goals, Chhabra reveals some surprising facts about wealth creation, reinterprets the success formulas of investing greats like Warren Buffett, and bridges the gap between theory and practice. The Aspirational Investor places us on a road to more confident and fulfilled financial lives by raising the bar for what we should expect from our investment portfolios\u2014and our financial advisors.",

            "description": "Recommended Reading by Warren Buffet in his March 2013 Letter to Shareholders.How speculation has come to dominate investment\u2014a hard-hitting look from the creator of the first index fund.Over the course of his sixty-year career in the mutual fund industry, Vanguard Group founder John C. Bogle has witnessed a massive shift in the culture of the financial sector. The prudent, value-adding culture of long-term investment has been crowded out by an aggressive, value-destroying culture of short-term speculation. Mr. Bogle has not been merely an eye-witness to these changes, but one of the financial sector\u2019s most active participants. In The Clash of the Cultures, he urges a return to the common sense principles of long-term investing.Provocative and refreshingly candid, this book discusses Mr. Bogle's views on the changing culture in the mutual fund industry, how speculation has invaded our national retirement system, the failure of our institutional money managers to effectively participate in corporate governance, and the need for a federal standard of fiduciary duty.Mr. Bogle recounts the history of the index mutual fund, how he created it, and how exchange-traded index funds have altered its original concept of long-term investing. He also presents a first-hand history of Wellington Fund, a real-world case study on the success of investment and the failure of speculation. The book concludes with ten simple rules that will help investors meet their financial goals. Here, he presents a common sense strategy that \"may not be the best strategy ever devised. But the number of strategies that are worse is infinite.\"The Clash of the Cultures: Investment vs. Speculation completes the trilogy of best-selling books, beginning with Bogle on Investing: The First 50 Years (2001) and Don't Count on It! (2011)",

            "description": "In the spirit of Wendy Mogel\u2019s The Blessing of a Skinned Knee and Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman\u2019s Nurture Shock, New York Times \u201cYour Money\u201d columnist Ron Lieber delivers a taboo-shattering manifesto that explains how talking openly to children about money can help parents raise modest, patient, grounded young adults who are financially wise beyond their years.For Ron Lieber, a personal finance columnist and father, good parenting means talking about money with our kids. Children are hyper-aware of money, and they have scores of questions about its nuances. But when parents shy away from the topic, they lose a tremendous opportunity\u2014not just to model the basic financial behaviors that are increasingly important for young adults but also to imprint lessons about what the family truly values.Written in a warm, accessible voice, grounded in real-world experience and stories from families with a range of incomes, The Opposite of Spoiled is both a practical guidebook and a values-based philosophy. The foundation of the book is a detailed blueprint for the best ways to handle the basics: the tooth fairy, allowance, chores, charity, saving, birthdays, holidays, cell phones, checking accounts, clothing, cars, part-time jobs, and college tuition. It identifies a set of traits and virtues that embody the opposite of spoiled, and shares how to embrace the topic of money to help parents raise kids who are more generous and less materialistic.But The Opposite of Spoiled is also a promise to our kids that we will make them better with money than we are. It is for all of the parents who know that honest conversations about money with their curious children can help them become more patient and prudent, but who don\u2019t know how and when to start.",

Branded a fraud by the \"Wall Street Journal\" and \"New York Times,\" and investigated by Eliot Spitzer and the Securities and Exchange Commission, Ackman later made his investors more than $1 billion when bond insurers kicked off the collapse of the credit markets.Unravels the story of the credit crisis through an engaging and human dramaDraws on unprecedented access to one of Wall Street's best-known investorsShows how excessive leverage, dangerous financial models, and a blind reliance on triple-A credit ratings sent Wall Street careening toward disasterConfidence Game is a real world \"Emperor's New Clothes,\" a tale of widespread delusion, and one dissenting voice in the era leading up to the worst financial disaster since the Great Depression.",

            "description": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER. A roadmap to what lies ahead and the decisions we must make now to stave off the next global economic and financial crisis, from one of the world\u2019s most influential economic thinkers and the author of When Markets CollideOur current economic path is coming to an end. The signposts are all around us: sluggish growth, rising inequality, stubbornly high pockets of unemployment, and jittery financial markets, to name a few. Soon we will reach a fork in the road: One path leads to renewed growth, prosperity, and financial stability, the other to recession and market disorder.In The Only Game in Town, El-Erian casts his gaze toward the future of the global economy and markets, outlining the choices we face both individually and collectively in an era of economic uncertainty and financial insecurity. Beginning with their response to the 2008 global crisis, El-Erian explains how and why our central banks became the critical policy actors\u2014and, most important, why they cannot continue is this role alone. They saved the financial system from collapse in 2008 and a multiyear economic depression, but lack the tools to enable a return to high inclusive growth and durable financial stability. The time has come for a policy handoff, from a prolonged period of monetary policy experimentation to a strategy that better targets what ails economies and distorts the financial sector\u2014before we stumble into another crisis.The future, critically, is not predestined. It is up to us to decide where we will go from here as households, investors, companies, and governments. Using a mix of insights from economics, finance, and behavioral science, this book gives us the tools we need to properly understand this turning point, prepare for it, and come out of it stronger. A comprehensive, controversial look at the realities of our global economy and markets, The Only Game in Town is required reading for investors, policymakers, and anyone interested in the future.",

It works. And it will work for you.Not that long ago though, my business had gotten so bad that I literally couldn\u2019t even give my services away for free. At the end of each month, I would look at my bank account hoping to see progress (but there wasn\u2019t). I knew something had to change...but what?Over the next 48 months, I went from losing money to making $36 for every $1 spent. In that time period, we generated over $120,000,000 across four different industries: service, ecommerce, software, and brick & mortar.But, unlike everyone else, we didn\u2019t have great funnels, great ads, or a wealthy niche. In fact, we didn\u2019t even send emails until we had crossed $50M in sales(!). Instead, we were able to do this one thing really well\u2026.we created offers so good, people felt stupid saying no.",

            "description": "Get fifty years of industry-defining expertise in a single volume.John Bogle on Investing is a compilation of the best speeches ever delivered by one of the 20th century's towering financial giants. Individually, each of these speeches delivers a powerful lesson in investing; taken together, Bogle's lifelong themes ring loud and clear. His investing philosophy has remained more or less constant throughout his illustrious career, and this book lays it out so you can learn from the very best. You'll learn what makes a successful investment strategy, consider the productive economics of long-term investing, and how emotional investment in financial markets is often counterproductive enough to forfeit success. Bogle discusses the \"fiscal drag\" of investing, and shows you how to cut down on sales charges, management fees, turnover costs, and opportunity costs, as he unravels a lifetime's worth of expertise to give you deep insight into the mind of a master at work.John C. Bogle founded Vanguard in 1974, then in the space of a few years, introduced the index mutual fund, pioneered the no-load mutual fund, and redefined bond fund management. This book wraps up the essence of his half-century of knowledge to deepen your understanding and enhance your investment success.",

            "description": "Mastering Bitcoin is essential reading for everyone interested in learning about bitcoin basics, the technical operation of bitcoin, or if you're building the next great bitcoin killer app or business. From using a bitcoin wallet to buy a cup of coffee, to running a bitcoin marketplace with hundreds of thousands of transactions, or collaboratively building new financial innovations that will transform our understanding of currency and credit, this book will help you engineer money. You're about to unlock the API to a new economy. This book is your key.This book will help you learn everything you need to know about decentralized digital money, which is one of the most exciting technical revolutions in decades. Just as the Internet has transformed dozens of industries - from media and entertainment to retailing, travel and many more - decentralized digital money, in the form of crypto-currencies, has the ability to transform the foundations of money, credit and financial services. It also has the power to transform other social activities and institutions that we don't usually associate directly with money, such as corporations, governance, voting and the law.As the first successful digital currency, bitcoin is the natural starting point for anyone interested in decentralized digital money, its implications and applications. Mastering Bitcoin describes the technical foundations of bitcoin and other cryptographic currencies, from cryptography basics, such as keys and addresses, to the data structures, network protocols and the consensus mechanism (\"mining\") that underpin bitcoin. Each technical topic is explained with user stories, elegant analogies and examples, and code snippets illustrating the key concepts. The first two chapters offer a broad and accessible introduction to bitcoin that is intended for all audiences, from new non-technical users to investors and business executives seeking to better understand bitcoin. The remainder of the book dives into the technical details of bitcoin's operation and is aimed at professional developers, engineers, software and systems architects, systems administrators and technically-minded people interested in the inner workings of bitcoin and comparable crypto-currencies. Mastering Bitcoin is intended to be used as a reference book for technical professionals, as a self-study guide for bitcoin entrepreneurs, and as a textbook for university courses on bitcoin and digital currencies.Bitcoin is still in its infancy, and yet it has already spawned a multi-billion dollar, global economy that is growing exponentially. Both new and established companies are adding bitcoin as a payment method, and investors are funding a flurry of new bitcoin and related startups. Mastering Bitcoin can help you become part of this vibrant new economy. The time to get started is now.",

            "description": "The essential guide to making smarter decisions by decoding CEO Communications.Recommended reading in Warren Buffet\u2019s 2013 Shareholder Letter.Investing Between the Lines introduces a revolutionary method for evaluating the financial integrity of a company. You don\u2019t need special access to \u201cinsider\u201d information or a degree in accounting to figure it out. In fact, the secret is right in front of you\u2014in black and white\u2014in the words of every shareholder letter, annual report, and corporate correspondence you receive.Too often, corporate executives and investment professionals are expected to deliver short-term results. As a result, they are compelled to turn to accounting techniques and unclear language to meet these expectations.In Investing Between the Lines, L.J. Rittenhouse lays out her time-tested approach for recognizing at-risk businesses before trouble hits. This is the same method she used to predict the collapse of Enron and the fall of Lehman.From comparing the statements of Ford, GM, and Toyota to revealing why FedEx and Wells Fargo have been so successful, Investing Between the Lines shows that Rittenhouse\u2019s system is one of the most powerful tools a corporate leader or investor can have. Once you learn the clues to decode CEO communications, you will be able to invest between the lines\u2014to figure out exactly what a company\u2019s CEO is or isn\u2019t telling you.Whether you\u2019re a professional investor, a new shareholder, or a CEO who wants to improve how your company communicates, Investing Between the Lines is one of the best investments you\u2019ll ever make.",

            "description": "Two professors combine their fascinating and cutting-edge research in behavioral science to explain how money can buy happiness\u2014if you follow five core principles of smart spending.Most people recognize that they need professional advice on how to earn, save, and invest their money. When it comes to spending that money, most people just follow their intuitions. But scientific research shows that those intuitions are often wrong.Happy Money offers a tour of research on the science of spending, explaining how you can get more happiness for your money. Authors Elizabeth Dunn and Michael Norton have outlined five principles\u2014from choosing experiences over stuff to spending money on others\u2014to guide not only individuals looking for financial security, but also companies seeking to create happier employees and provide \u201chappier products\u201d to their customers. Dunn and Norton show how companies from Google to Pepsi to Charmin have put these ideas into action.Along the way, Dunn and Norton explore fascinating research that reveals that luxury cars often provide no more pleasure than economy models, that commercials can actually enhance the enjoyment of watching television, and that residents of many cities frequently miss out on inexpensive pleasures in their hometowns. By the end of this \u201clively and engaging book\u201d (Dan Gilbert, author of Stumbling on Happiness), you\u2019ll be asking yourself one simple question every time you reach for your wallet: Am I getting the biggest happiness bang for my buck?",

            "description": "In his rich and nuanced portrait of the remarkable, elusive Rothschild family, Oxford scholar and bestselling author Niall Ferguson uncovers the secrets behind the family's phenomenal economic success. He reveals for the first time the details of the family's vast political network, which gave it access to and influence over many of the greatest statesmen of the age. And he tells a family saga, tracing the importance of unity and the profound role of Judaism in the lives of a dynasty that rose from the confines of the Frankfurt ghetto and later used its influence to assist oppressed Jews throughout Europe. A definitive work of impeccable scholarship with a thoroughly engaging narrative, The House of Rothschild is a biography of the rarest kind, in which mysterious and fascinating historical figures finally spring to life.",

            "description": "In the post-meltdown world, it is irresponsible, ineffective, and ultimately useless to have a serious economic debate without considering and challenging the role of the Federal Reserve.Most people think of the Fed as an indispensable institution without which the country's economy could not properly function. But in End the Fed, Ron Paul draws on American history, economics, and fascinating stories from his own long political life to argue that the Fed is both corrupt and unconstitutional. It is inflating currency today at nearly a Weimar or Zimbabwe level, a practice that threatens to put us into an inflationary depression where $100 bills are worthless. What most people don't realize is that the Fed -- created by the Morgans and Rockefellers at a private club off the coast of Georgia -- is actually working against their own personal interests. Congressman Paul's urgent appeal to all citizens and officials tells us where we went wrong and what we need to do fix America's economic policy for future generations.",

            "description": "PHIL BEUTH spent his entire broadcasting career with one company. As the first employee of a fledgling media startup in 1955, Phil worked his way up over a 40-year span, as Capital Cities grew to become one of America's most influential and successful media companies. Limping on Water is a Dickensian rags-to-riches tale of a disadvantaged boy, born with cerebral palsy who, through luck, pluck, strength of character, skill, persistence and loyalty, rose to become a top executive at one of America's most respected and successful media companies, Capital Cities Communications; \"The minnow that swallowed the whale.\" Phil was born in a blue-collar neighborhood of Staten Island to parents of English and German stock in 1932.To state that his origins were humble is like saying the Yankees know a thing or two about baseball. The young struggling family was crushed by the tragic death of Phil's father when Phil was just four, causing his mother to park her young, physically impaired son with her step-father, an embittered, war-wounded veteran (of the Spanish-American War!), who ran a ramshackle \"Sanford and Son\" junk business out of his backyard. What propelled this boy to raise himself by his orthopedic bootstraps to become a respected and honored leader in his field, a member of two Broadcasting Halls of Fame, head of Good Morning America and a Division President of ABC? What comes through this very personal account--peppered with interesting and amusing anecdotes about his partners and celebrities like Ted Knight, Lowell Thomas, Charlie Gibson, Sir Paul McCartney, Frank Sinatra, Cher, Jackie Robinson, Red Barber, Nelson Rockefeller, Barbara Walters, Warren Buffett, Sammy Davis Jr., Burt Reynolds, Red Skelton, Muhammad Ali, and many more--is Phil's generosity, self-deprecating humor, unbound creativity and warm-hearted congenial talent. More than simply recollections of a career at a celebrated company and the famous people encountered along his path, Phil's story is a keen insider's chronicle of that \"Mad Men\" golden era of television; a time when broadcasting as we know it came into being. It is also a powerful lesson in forging a career that is ethical and prosperous; \"doing well and doing good.\"",

You'll never find a wiser advisor with a bigger heart.\u201d -- Malachi Rempen: Filmmaker, cartoonist, author and self-described ruffianThis book grew out of a series of letters to my daughter concerning various things\u2014mostly about money and investing\u2014she was not yet quite ready to hear.Since money is the single most powerful tool we have for navigating this complex world we\u2019ve created, understanding it is critical.\u201cBut Dad,\u201d she once said, \u201cI know money is important. I just don\u2019t want to spend my life thinking about it.\u201d This was eye-opening. I love this stuff. But most people have better things to do with their precious time. Bridges to build, diseases to cure, treaties to negotiate, mountains to climb, technologies to create, children to teach, businesses to run.Unfortunately, benign neglect of things financial leaves you open to the charlatans of the financial world. The people who make investing endlessly complex, because if it can be made complex it becomes more profitable for them, more expensive for us, and we are forced into their waiting arms.Here\u2019s an important truth: Complex investments exist only to profit those who create and sell them. Not only are they more costly to the investor, they are less effective.The simple approach I created for her and present now to you, is not only easy to understand and implement, it is more powerful than any other.",

            "description": "October 19th 1987 was a day of huge change for the global finance industry. On this day the stock market crashed, the Nobel Prize winning Black-Scholes formula failed and volatility smiles were born, and on this day Elie Ayache began his career, on the trading floor of the French Futures and Options Exchange.Experts everywhere sought to find a model for this event, and ways to simulate it in order to avoid a recurrence in the future, but the one thing that struck Elie that day was the belief that what actually happened on 19th October 1987 is simply non reproducible outside 19th October 1987 - you cannot reduce it to a chain of causes and effects, or even to a random generator, that can then be reproduced or represented in a theoretical framework.\u200dThe Blank Swan is Elie's highly original treatise on the financial markets - presenting a totally revolutionary rethinking of derivative pricing and technology. It is not a diatribe against Nassim Taleb's The Black Swan, but criticises the whole background or framework of predictable and unpredictable events - white and black swans alike -, i.e. the very category of prediction.In this revolutionary book, Elie redefines the components of the technology needed to price and trade derivatives. Most importantly, and drawing on a long tradition of philosophy of the event from Henri Bergson to Gilles Deleuze, to Alain Badiou, and on a recent brand of philosophy of contingency, embodied by the speculative materialism of Quentin Meillassoux, Elie redefines the market itself against the common perceptions of orthodox financial theory, general equilibrium theory and the sociology of finance.This book will change the way that we think about derivatives and approach the market. If anything, derivatives should be renamed contingent claims, where contingency is now absolute and no longer derivative, and the market is just its medium. The book also establishes the missing link between quantitative modelling (no longer dependent on probability theory but on a novel brand of mathematics which Elie calls the mathematics of price) and the reality of the market.\"",

            "description": "Emanuel Derman worked at Goldman Sachs as a quantitative analyst (Quant), one of the financial engineers whose computer models supplanted Wall Street traders' intuition. The economy suffered as a result of traders' dependence on such quantitative analysis, which triggered a sequence of financial crises that began in 2007 with the mortgage crisis and from which we are still recovering. Derman examines why people, particularly bankers, continue to place so much confidence in these models, and why this is such a bad idea. Despite the fact that financial models use mathematical language to approximate the manner of physics, they ultimately deal with people. Their resemblance obscures the underlying contrast between the goals and probable outcomes of the psychological and financial worlds. When we construct a human-scale replica, we're attempting to push Cinderella's ugly stepsister's foot into Cinderella's lovely glass slipper. It won't fit without removing some of the most important components. Physicists and economists have been too eager to admit the limitations of their equations in the realm of human behaviour, which is, after all, what economics is about.Models. Behaving. Badly.\u00a0features a personal storey of Derman's boyhood encounters with failed models\u2014the kibbutz paradise, his career as a physicist on Wall Street, and a look at the models quants generated: the advantages they gave and the difficulties they produced. Derman examines what a model is before pointing out the discrepancies between modeling's success in physics and its relative failure in economics. Derman advises us to quit depending on these models whenever feasible after the subprime mortgage CDO market collapsed in 2007, and he gives solutions for repairing these models where they could still be useful. This is an interesting, poetic, and very human look into the junction between mathematics and human nature.",

Two of the story's iconic characters are Harvard students Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss: identical twins, Olympic rowers, and foils to Mark Zuckerberg. Bitcoin Billionaires is the story of the brothers\u2019 redemption and revenge in the wake of their epic legal battle with Facebook. Planning to start careers as venture capitalists, the brothers quickly discover that no one will take their money after their fight with Zuckerberg. While nursing their wounds in Ibiza, they accidentally run into an eccentric character who tells them about a brand-new idea: cryptocurrency. Immersing themselves in what is then an obscure and sometimes sinister world, they begin to realize \u201ccrypto\u201d is, in their own words, \"either the next big thing or total bulls--t.\" There\u2019s nothing left to do but make a bet. From the Silk Road to the halls of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Bitcoin Billionaires will take us on a wild and surprising ride while illuminating a tantalizing economic future. On November 26, 2017, the Winklevoss brothers became the first bitcoin billionaires. Here\u2019s the story of how they got there\u2015as only Ben Mezrich could tell it.",

            "description": "Philanthropy is a booming business, with hundreds of billions of dollars committed to the social sector each year. Money Well Spent, an award-winning guide on how to structure philanthropy so that it really makes a difference, offers a comprehensive and crucial resource for individual donors, foundations, non-profits, and scholars who focus on and teach others about this realm.Behind every successful grant is a smart strategy. Paul Brest and Hal Harvey draw on the experiences of hundreds of foundations and non-profits to explain how to deliver on every dollar. They present the essential tools to help readers create and test effective plans for achieving demonstrable results. Brest and Harvey tackle thorny issues, such as how to choose among different forms of funding, how to measure progress, and when to abandon a project that isn't working.The second edition accounts for a decade of progress: a rise in impact investing, the advent of pay-for-success programs, the maturation of impact evaluation, and the emergence of a new generation of mega-donors. Today, the notion of results-driven philanthropy is more important than ever. With this book, the social sector has the techniques it needs to deliver on that idea with impact.",

            "description": "Our innovation economy is broken. But there's good news: The ideas that will solve our problems are hiding in plain sight.While big companies in the American economy have never been more successful, entrepreneurial activity is near a 30-year low. More businesses are dying than starting every day. Investors continue to dump billions of dollars into photo-sharing apps and food-delivery services, solving problems for only a wealthy sliver of the world's population, while challenges in health, food security, and education grow more serious.In The Innovation Blind Spot, entrepreneur and venture capitalist Ross Baird argues that the innovations that truly matter don't see the light of day--for reasons entirely of our own making. A handful of people in a handful of cities are deciding, behind closed doors, which entrepreneurs get a shot to succeed. And most investors are what Baird calls \"two-pocket thinkers\"--artificially separating their charitable work from their day job of making a profit.The resulting system creates rising income inequality, stifled entrepreneurial ambition, social distrust, and political uncertainty. Our innovation problem makes all our other problems harder to solve. In this book, Baird demonstrates how and where to find better ideas by lifting up people, places, and industries that are often overlooked. What's more, Baird ultimately outlines how to create long-term success through \"one-pocket thinking\"--eliminating the blind spot that separates \"what we do for a living\" and \"what we really care about.\"",

            "description": "Is Wall Street bad for Main Street America?\"A well-told exploration of why our current economy is leaving too many behind.\" \u2014The New York TimesIn looking at the forces that shaped the 2016 presidential election, one thing is clear: much of the population believes that our economic system is rigged to enrich the privileged elites at the expense of hard-working Americans. This is a belief held equally on both sides of political spectrum, and it seems only to be gaining momentum. A key reason, says Financial Times columnist Rana Foroohar, is the fact that Wall Street is no longer supporting Main Street businesses that create the jobs for the middle and working class. She draws on in-depth reporting and interviews at the highest rungs of business and government to show how the \u201cfinancialization of America\u201d\u2014the phenomenon by which finance and its way of thinking have come to dominate every corner of business\u2014is threatening the American Dream. Now updated with new material explaining how our corrupted financial sys\u00adtem propelled Donald Trump to power, Makers and Takers explores the confluence of forces that has led American businesses to favor balance-sheet engineering over the actual kind, greed over growth, and short-term profits over putting people to work. From the cozy relationship between Wall Street and Washington, to a tax code designed to benefit wealthy individuals and corporations, to forty years of bad policy decisions, she shows why so many Americans have lost trust in the sys\u00adtem, and why it matters urgently to us all.

            "description": "When Sheryl Sculley was recruited to serve as San Antonio's new city manager in 2005, the organization she inherited was a disorganized mess. City infrastructure was crumbling, strong financial policies and systems were nonexistent, many executive positions were vacant, public satisfaction was low, ethical standards were weak, and public safety union salaries and benefits were outpacing revenues, crowding out other essential city services. Simply put: San Antonio was on the verge of collapse.Greedy Bastards tells the story of Sheryl and her new team's uphill battle to turn around San Antonio city government. She takes you behind closed doors to share the hard changes she made and the strategies she used to create mutually beneficial solutions to the city's biggest problems.Many of the issues Sheryl found in San Antonio are present in cities across the US. Packed with wins and losses, lessons learned, and pitfalls encountered, Greedy Bastards is a guidebook for any city official tasked with turning around a struggling city.",

            "description": "The Warren Buffett Way provided the first look into the strategies that the master uses to pick stocks. A New York Times bestseller, it is a valuable and practical primer on the principles behind the remarkable investment run of the famed oracle of Omaha. In this much-awaited companion to that book, author Robert Hagstrom takes the next logical step, revealing how to profitably manage stocks once you select them. THE WARREN BUFFETT PORTFOLIO will help you through the process of building a superior portfolio and managing the stocks going forward.Building a concentrated portfolio is critical for investment success. THE WARREN BUFFETT PORTFOLIO introduces the next wave of investment strategy, called focus investing. A comprehensive investment strategy used with spectacular results by Buffett, focus investing directs investors to select a concentrated group of businesses by examining their management and financial positions as compared to their stock prices. A strategy that has historically outperformed the market, focus investing is based on the principle that a shareholder's return from owning a stock is ultimately determined by the economics of the underlying business.Hagstrom explains in easy-to-understand terms exactly what focus investing is, how it works, and how it can be applied by any investor at any level of experience. He demonstrates how Buffett arranges his stocks in a focus portfolio and reveals why this is as responsible for his incredible returns as the individual stocks he picks. Ultimately, Hagstrom shows how to use this technique to build and manage a portfolio to achieve the best possible results.",

With her signature mix of insight, compassion, and soul-deep recognition, she equips women with the financial knowledge and emotional awareness to overcome the blocks that have kept them from making more out of the money they make. At the center of the book is The Save Yourself Plan--a streamlined, five-month program that delivers genuine long-term financial security. But what's at stake is far bigger than money itself: It's about every woman's sense of who she is and what she deserves, and why it all begins with the decision to save yourself.",

But what happens when they run into the one thing in business they can't control: each other?This fast-paced book tells the story of the clash of these two titans over Herbalife, a nutritional supplement company whose business model Ackman questioned. Icahn decided to vouch for them, and the dispute became a years-long feud, complete with secret backroom deals, public accusations, billions of dollars in stock trades, and one dramatic insult war on live television. Wapner, who hosted that memorable TV show, has gained unprecedented access to all the players and unravels this remarkable war of egos, showing the extreme measures the participants were willing to take.When the Wolves Bite is both a rollicking, entertaining read--a great business story of money and power and pride.",

            "description": "This highly praised introductory treatment describes the parallels between statistical physics and finance - both those established in the 100-year long interaction between these disciplines, as well as new research results on financial markets. The random-walk technique, well known in physics, is also the basic model in finance, upon which are built, for example, the Black-Scholes theory of option pricing and hedging, plus methods of portfolio optimization. Here the underlying assumptions are assessed critically. Using empirical financial data and analogies to physical models such as fluid flows, turbulence, or superdiffusion, the book develops a more accurate description of financial markets based on random walks. With this approach, novel methods for derivative pricing and risk management can be formulated.Computer simulations of interacting-agent models provide insight into the mechanisms underlying unconventional price dynamics. It is shown that stock exchange crashes can be modelled in ways analogous to phase transitions and earthquakes, and sometimes have even been predicted successfully. This third edition of \"The Statistical Mechanics of Financial Markets\" especially stands apart from other treatments because it offers new chapters containing a practitioner's treatment of two important current topics in banking: the basic notions and tools of risk management and capital requirements for financial institutions, including an overview of the new Basel II capital framework which may well set the risk management standards in scores of countries for years to come.",

            "description": "When the official history of twentieth-century Wall Street is written, Michael Steinhardt will almost definitely be included prominently. Steinhardt, one of the most successful money managers in \"The Street's\" history, outperformed his rivals by attaining an average yearly return of over thirty percent, which was much higher than any market benchmark. He accumulated huge riches for his clients and himself throughout his almost thirty-year employment as a hedge fund manager. When he withdrew from active money management in 1995, a dollar invested in Steinhardt Partners L.P., his flagship hedge fund, at its founding in 1967 would have been worth $462.No Bull focuses on Michael Steinhardt's talents as an industry analyst and consummate stock picker, as well as some of the financial tactics that propelled his unprecedented success as a hedge fund manager. He also explains how his remarkable ability to discern when to trade against the current market trend\u2014a gift that was not always acknowledged by numerous former high-profile clients\u2014was important in several of his greatest wins. He describes in detail some of his most spectacular successes\u2014including his historic choice to bet everything on bonds in 1981--as well as his equally spectacular failures, such as his disastrous venture into global macro-trading in the mid-1990s.At the same time, No Bull is a rags-to-riches tale about a young man from Bensonhurst who rises from the slums of Brooklyn to the top of Wall Street. Steinhardt recalls the early influences that formed his perspectives on life and achievement, as well as the beginning of his love affair with stock investment, in a truly captivating book. He also describes how his growing realization of the need for a purpose in life beyond accumulating fortune led to his choice to retire and redirect his activities. We learn about his nearly a decade as chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, as well as his innovative thinking and ambitious efforts to enhance the Jewish community.No Bull is an unforgettable read for finance professionals and students of human nature alike, as it tells the inspiring true story of a Wall Street genius and world-class philanthropist.Michael Steinhardt is regarded as one of Wall Street's most successful money managers. He is also well-known for his charitable endeavors, particularly in the Jewish community, where he co-founded birthright Israel with Charles Bronfman, a program whose purpose is to give a free educational opportunity for every young Jewish Diaspora person to visit Israel.",

He has also been friends with some of the most successful people in business history, including Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Jack Welch, Rupert Murdoch, and Peter Drucker.Now this elder statesman reveals how great enterprises get into trouble. Even the smartest executives can fall into the trap of believing in their own infallibility. When that happens, more bad decisions are sure to follow.This light-hearted \u201chow-not-to\u201d book includes anecdotes from Keough's long career as well as other infamous failures. His commandments for failure include: Quit Taking Risks; Be Inflexible; Assume Infallibility; Put All Your Faith in Experts; Send Mixed Messages; and Be Afraid of the Future.As he writes, \u201cAfter a lifetime in business I've never been able to develop a step-by-step formula that will guarantee success. What I could do, however, was talk about how to lose. I guarantee that anyone who follows my formula will be a highly successful loser.\u201d",

            "description": "It\u2019s no secret that these hard times have been even harder for the Black community.Approximately 35 percent of African Americans had no measurable assets in 2009, and 24 percent of these same households had only a motor vehicle. Dennis Kimbro, observing how the weight of the continuing housing and credit crises disproportionately impacts the African-American community, takes a sharp look at a carefully cultivated group of individuals who\u2019ve scaled the heights of success and how others can emulate them.Based on a seven year study of 1,000 of the wealthiest African Americans, The Wealth Choice offers a trove of sound and surprising advice about climbing the economic ladder, even when the odds seem stacked against you. Readers will learn about how business leaders, entrepreneurs, and celebrities like Bob Johnson, Spike Lee, L. A. Reid, Herman Cain, T. D. Jakes and Tyrese Gibson found their paths to wealth; what they did or didn\u2019t learn about money early on; what they had to sacrifice to get to the top; and the role of discipline in managing their success.",

It's packed with parallels and parables for the modern reader.\" -From the Foreword by Richard Lambert Editor-in-Chief, The Financial Times Once in Golconda is a dramatic chronicle of the breathtaking rise, devastating fall, and painstaking rebirth of Wall Street in the years between the wars.Focusing on the lives and fortunes of some of the era's most memorable traders, bankers, boosters, and frauds, John Brooks brings to vivid life all the ruthlessness, greed, and reckless euphoria of the '20s bull market, the desperation of the days leading up to the crash of '29, and the bitterness of the years that followed.",

            "description": "The winners of the Nobel Prize show how economics, when done right, can help us solve the thorniest social and political problems of our day.Figuring out how to deal with today's critical economic problems is perhaps the great challenge of our time. Much greater than space travel or perhaps even the next revolutionary medical breakthrough, what is at stake is the whole idea of the good life as we have known it.Immigration and inequality, globalization and technological disruption, slowing growth and accelerating climate change--these are sources of great anxiety across the world, from New Delhi and Dakar to Paris and Washington, DC. The resources to address these challenges are there--what we lack are ideas that will help us jump the wall of disagreement and distrust that divides us. If we succeed, history will remember our era with gratitude; if we fail, the potential losses are incalculable.In this revolutionary book, renowned MIT economists Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo take on this challenge, building on cutting-edge research in economics explained with lucidity and grace. Original, provocative, and urgent, Good Economics for Hard Times makes a persuasive case for an intelligent interventionism and a society built on compassion and respect. It is an extraordinary achievement, one that shines a light to help us appreciate and understand our precariously balanced world.",

            "description": "Will the sun set on the greatest currency in the history of the world?For decades the dollar has been the undisputed champ. It\u2019s not only the currency of America but much of the world as well, the fuel of global prosperity. As the superengine of the world\u2019s only superpower, it\u2019s accepted everywhere. When an Asian company trades with South America, those transactions are done in dollars, the currency of international business.But for how much longer? Economists fear America is digging a hole with an economy based on massive borrowing and huge deficits that cloud the dollar\u2019s future. Will the buck be eclipsed by the euro or even China\u2019s renminbi? Should Americans worry when the value of the mighty U.S. dollar sinks to par with the Canadian \u201cloonie\u201d?Craig Karmin\u2019s in-depth \u201cbiography\u201d of the dollar explores these issues. It also examines the green-back\u2019s history, allure, and unique role as a catalyst for globalization, and how the American buck became so almighty that $ became perhaps the most powerful symbol on earth.Biography of the Dollar explores every aspect of its subject: the power of the Federal Reserve, the inner sanctums of foreign central banks that stockpile the currency, and the little-known circles of foreign exchange traders that determine a currency\u2019s worth. It traces the dollar\u2019s ascendancy, including one incredibly important duck-hunting trip and the world-changing Bretton Woods Conference.With its watermark, color-shifting inks, and a presidential portrait that glows under ultraviolet light, the dollar has obsessed foreign governments, some of which have tried to counterfeit it. Even Saddam Hussein, who insisted on being paid in euros for oil, had $750,000 in hundred-dollar bills when captured. Yet if a worldwide currency has enabled a global economy to flourish, it\u2019s also allowed the United States to owe unbelievable, shocking amounts of money\u2014paying hundreds of millions of dollars every single day just in interest on foreign debt; that\u2019s raised concerns that the dollar standard may not be sustainable.Any threat to the dollar\u2019s privileged status would do much more than hurt American pride. It would mean U.S. companies and citizens would not be able to borrow at the low rates they have become accustomed to. The dollar\u2019s demise would impact the rest of the world, too, boosting the costs of trade and investment if no other currency was able to play the same crucial role. Ultimately the dollar system may weaken, but it should endure\u2014a while longer, at least; it\u2019s in few people\u2019s interest to see it fail, and there is still no credible alternative.Biography of the Dollar is must reading for anyone who wants to understand what truly makes the world go \u2019round\u2014and whether it will continue to spin the way we want it to.",

Recognizing that, as Ben put it, \"the enemy is forgetting,\" they examine the causes of the crisis, why it was so damaging, and what it ultimately took to prevent a second Great Depression. And they provide to their successors in the United States and the finance ministers and central bank governors of other countries a valuable playbook for reducing the damage from future financial crises. Firefighting provides a candid and powerful account of the choices they and their teams made during the crisis, working under two presidents and with the leaders of Congress.",

            "description": "From Michael J. Casey and Paul Vigna, the authors of The Age of Cryptocurrency, comes the definitive work on the Internet\u2019s Next Big Thing: The Blockchain.Big banks have grown bigger and more entrenched. Privacy exists only until the next hack. Credit card fraud is a fact of life. Many of the \u201clegacy systems\u201d once designed to make our lives easier and our economy more efficient are no longer up to the task. Yet there is a way past all this\u2015a new kind of operating system with the potential to revolutionize vast swaths of our economy: the blockchain.In The Truth Machine, Michael J. Casey and Paul Vigna demystify the blockchain and explain why it can restore personal control over our data, assets, and identities; grant billions of excluded people access to the global economy; and shift the balance of power to revive society\u2019s faith in itself. They reveal the disruption it promises for industries including finance, tech, legal, and shipping.Casey and Vigna expose the challenge of replacing trusted (and not-so-trusted) institutions on which we\u2019ve relied for centuries with a radical model that bypasses them. The Truth Machine reveals the empowerment possible when self-interested middlemen give way to the transparency of the blockchain, while highlighting the job losses, assertion of special interests, and threat to social cohesion that will accompany this shift. With the same balanced perspective they brought to The Age of Cryptocurrency, Casey and Vigna show why we all must care about the path that blockchain technology takes\u2015moving humanity forward, not backward.",

            "description": "No one is better suited to inform us about the financial system's shortcomings and the heinous abuses that have occurred in recent years than John Bogle, the founder and former CEO of the Vanguard mutual funds company, who has intimate knowledge of the financial industry's inner workings. Bogle has championed the restoration of integrity in industry processes for more than fifty years as a fervent advocate for the little investor. As a keen observer and analyst, he understands that a reliable business and financial complex is critical to America's global leadership and domestic social and economic advancement.This book relates not just the tale of what went wrong, but also the story of why we lost our path and how we might get back on track. Bogle advocates for a return to a governance framework in which risked capital is invested in the interests of the owners rather than corporate and financial management. Given the concentration of ownership in the hands of a few major mutual and pension funds, the particular reforms outlined in this book are both necessary and possible. This well-informed book should be read by every investor, analyst, Wall Streeter, policymaker, and businessperson.",

Fisher in 1960, this timeless classic is now reintroduced by his well-known and respected son, successful money manager Ken Fisher, in a new Foreword.Filled with in-depth insights and expert advice, Paths to Wealth through Common Stocks expands upon the innovative ideas found in Fisher's highly regarded Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits -- summarizing how worthwhile profits have been and will continue to be made through common stock ownership, and revealing why his method can increase profits while reducing risk. Many of the ideas found here may depart from conventional investment wisdom, but the impressive results produced by these concepts -- which are still relevant in today's market environment -- will quickly remind you why Philip Fisher is considered one of the greatest investment minds of our time.",

            "description": "Secrets of the Millionaire Mind reveals the missing link between wanting success and achieving it!Have you ever wondered why some people seem to get rich easily, while others are destined for a life of financial struggle? Is the difference found in their education, intelligence, skills, timing, work habits, contacts, luck, or their choice of jobs, businesses, or investments?The shocking answer is: None of the above!In his groundbreaking Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, T. Harv Eker states: \"Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life!\" Eker does this by identifying your \"money and success blueprint.\" We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is this blueprint, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of money\u2014and if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success.\u200dSecrets of the Millionaire Mind is two books in one. Part I explains how your money blueprint works. Through Eker's rare combination of street smarts, humor, and heart, you will learn how your childhood influences have shaped your financial destiny. You will also learn how to identify your own money blueprint and \"revise\" it to not only create success but, more important, to keep and continually grow it.In Part II you will be introduced to seventeen \"Wealth Files,\" which describe exactly how rich people think and act differently than most poor and middle-class people. Each Wealth File includes action steps for you to practice in the real world in order to dramatically increase your income and accumulate wealth.If you are not doing as well financially as you would like, you will have to change your money blueprint. Unfortunately your current money blueprint will tend to stay with you for the rest of your life, unless you identify and revise it, and that's exactly what you will do with the help of this extraordinary book. According to T. Harv Eker, it's simple. If you think like rich people think and do what rich people do, chances are you'll get rich too!",

            "description": "An accessible analysis of the global expansion of financial markets in poor communities, incorporating the latest thinking and evidence.The microfinance revolution has allowed more than 150 million poor people around the world to receive small loans without collateral, build up assets, and buy insurance. The idea that providing access to reliable and affordable financial services can have powerful economic and social effects has captured the imagination of policymakers, activists, bankers, and researchers around the world; the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize went to microfinance pioneer Muhammed Yunis and Grameen Bank of Bangladesh. This book offers an accessible and engaging analysis of the global expansion of financial markets in poor communities. It introduces readers to the key ideas driving microfinance, integrating theory with empirical data and addressing a range of issues, including savings and insurance, the role of women, impact measurement, and management incentives. This second edition has been updated throughout to reflect the latest data. A new chapter on commercialization describes the rapid growth in investment in microfinance institutions and the tensions inherent in the efforts to meet both social and financial objectives. The chapters on credit contracts, savings and insurance, and gender have been expanded substantially; a new section in the chapter on impact measurement describes the growing importance of randomized controlled trials; and the chapter on managing microfinance offers a new perspective on governance issues in transforming institutions. Appendixes and problem sets cover technical material.",

Our good friend, Peter Bernstein mentioned this book several times in his excellent Capital Ideas which was published in 1992. Why the book is interesting today is that it still is important and the most authoritative work on how to value financial assets. As Peter says: \"Williams combined original theoretical concepts with enlightening and entertaining commentary based on his own experiences in the rough-and-tumble world of investment.\" Williams' discovery was to project an estimate that offers intrinsic value and it is called the 'Dividend Discount Model' which is still used today by professional investors on the institutional side of markets.

            "description": "A successful Wall Street trader turned Cambridge neuroscientist reveals the biology of financial boom and bust, showing how risk-taking transforms our body chemistry, driving us to extremes of euphoria or stressed-out depression.The laws of financial boom and bust, it turns out, have a lot to do with male hormones. In a series of startling experiments, Canadian scientist Dr. John Coates identified a feedback loop between testosterone and success that dramatically lowers the fear of risk in men, especially young men; he has vividly dubbed the moment when traders transform into exuberant high flyers \"the hour between dog and wolf.\" Similarly, intense failure leads to a rise in levels of cortisol, which dramatically lowers the appetite for risk. His book expands on his seminal research to offer lessons from the exploding new field studying the biology of risk.Coates's conclusions shed light on all types of high-pressure decision-making, from the sports field to the battlefield, and leaves us with a powerful recognition: to handle risk isn't a matter of mind over body, it's a matter of mind and body working together. We all have it in us to be transformed from dog to wolf; the only question is whether we can understand the causes and the consequences.",

            "description": "There were dozens of books about Watergate, but only All the President's Men gave readers the full story, with all the drama and nuance and exclusive reporting. And thirty years later, if you're going to read only one book on Watergate, that's still the one. Today, Enron is the biggest business story of our time, and Fortune senior writers Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind are the new Woodward and Bernstein.Remarkably, it was just two years ago that Enron was thought to epitomize a great New Economy company, with its skyrocketing profits and share price. But that was before Fortune published an article by McLean that asked a seemingly innocent question: How exactly does Enron make money? From that point on, Enron's house of cards began to crumble. Now, McLean and Elkind have investigated much deeper, to offer the definitive book about the Enron scandal and the fascinating people behind it.Meticulously researched and character driven, Smartest Guys in the Room takes the reader deep into Enron's past\u2014and behind the closed doors of private meetings. Drawing on a wide range of unique sources, the book follows Enron's rise from obscurity to the top of the business world to its disastrous demise. It reveals as never before major characters such as Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, and Andy Fastow, as well as lesser known players like Cliff Baxter and Rebecca Mark. Smartest Guys in the Room is a story of greed, arrogance, and deceit\u2014a microcosm of all that is wrong with American business today. Above all, it's a fascinating human drama that will prove to be the authoritative account of the Enron scandal.",

Were members of the middle class as prepared as the innovators claimed to take control of their financial lives? Or did events like the dot-com and the housing bubbles suggest something else: that far too many of us lacked the wherewithal to make sound investment decisions?",

            "description": "Following recent financial crises, it's easy to think of finance as a wrecking ball, destroying fortunes and jobs while undermining governments and banks. Leading financial historian William Goetzmann argues, in Money Changes Everything, that the development of finance has enabled the growth of civilizations. Finance, according to Goetzmann, is a time machine, a technology that allows us to transport value forward and backward in time; and this invention has transformed the way we think about and plan for the future. He demonstrates how money influenced significant events in history, such as the birth of writing in ancient Mesopotamia, the rise and collapse of dynasties in imperial China, and the financing of trade voyages that brought Europeans to the New World. He also shows how, over the course of human history, the machinery we associate with a contemporary economy stock markets, lines of credit, sophisticated financial instruments, and international trade were continuously built, forgotten, and remade.Goetzmann explains how wonderful financial tools and institutionsmoney, bonds, banks, businesses, and morehave helped urban centres develop and cultures flourish across millennia and around the world. And it's not finished transforming our lives, as Goetzmann analyses the issues we'll face in the future, such as how to utilise financial power to care for an elderly and growing population.Money Changes Everything is an enthralling look at how finance has influenced the path of history.",

            "description": "Why is paying for things painful?Why are we comfortable overpaying for something in the present just because we\u2019ve overpaid for it in the past?Why is it easy to pay $4 for a soda on vacation, when we wouldn\u2019t spend more than $1 on that same soda at our local grocery store?We think of money as numbers, values, and amounts, but when it comes down to it, when we actually use our money, we engage our hearts more than our heads. Emotions play a powerful role in shaping our financial behavior, often making us our own worst enemies as we try to save, access value, and spend responsibly. In Dollars and Sense, bestselling author and behavioral economist Dan Ariely teams up with financial comedian and writer Jeff Kreisler to challenge many of our most basic assumptions about the precarious relationship between our brains and our money. In doing so, they undermine many of personal finance\u2019s most sacred beliefs and explain how we can override some of our own instincts to make better financial choices.Exploring a wide range of everyday topics\u2014from the lure of pain-free spending with credit cards to the \u00a0pitfalls of household budgeting to the seductive power of holiday sales\u2014Ariely and Kreisler demonstrate how our misplaced confidence in our spending habits frequently leads us astray, costing us more than we realize, whether it\u2019s the real value of the time we spend driving forty-five minutes to save $10 or our inability to properly assess what the things we buy are actually worth. Together Ariely and Kreisler reveal the emotional forces working against us and how we can counteract them. Mixing case studies and anecdotes with concrete advice and lessons, they cut through the unconscious fears and desires driving our worst financial instincts and teach us how to improve our money habits.The result not only reveals the rationale behind our most head-scratching financial choices but also offers clear guidance for navigating the treacherous financial landscape of the brain. Fascinating, engaging, funny, and essential, Dollars and Sense provides the practical tools we need to understand and improve our financial choices, save and spend smarter, and ultimately live better.",

Now Bair is at the center of the financial crisis, speeding the takeover of failing banks and pressing the mortgage industry to ease loan terms . . . winning praise from Democrats and Republicans.\u201d \u2014BLOOMBERG NEWS, October 3, 2008Sheila Bair is widely acknowledged in government circles and the media as one of the first people to identify and accurately assess the subprime crisis. Appointed by George W. Bush as the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in 2006, she witnessed the origins of the financial crisis and in 2008 became\u2014along with Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke, and Timothy Geithner\u2014one of the key players trying to repair the damage to our economy. Bull by the Horns is her remarkable and refreshingly honest account of that contentious time and the struggle for reform that followed and continues to this day.",

            "description": "FIASCO is the shocking story of one man's education in the jungles of Wall Street. As a young derivatives salesman at Morgan Stanley, Frank Partnoy learned to buy and sell billions of dollars worth of securities that were so complex many traders themselves didn't understand them. In his behind-the-scenes look at the trading floor and the offices of one of the world's top investment firms, Partnoy recounts the macho attitudes and fiercely competitive ploys of his office mates. And he takes us to the annual drunken skeet-shooting competition, FIASCO, where he and his colleagues sharpen the killer instincts they are encouraged to use against their competitiors, their clients, and each other.FIASCO is the first book to take on the derivatves trading industry, the most highly charged and risky sector of the stock market. More importantly, it is a blistering indictment of the largely unregulated market in derivatives and serves as a warning to unwary investors about real fiascos, which have cost billions of dollars.",

            "description": "Economists generally accept as a given the old adage that there's no accounting for tastes. Nobel Laureate Gary Becker disagrees, and in this lively new collection he confronts the problem of preferences and values: how they are formed and how they affect our behavior. He argues that past experiences and social influences form two basic capital stocks: personal and social. He then applies these concepts to assessing the effects of advertising, the power of peer pressure, the nature of addiction, and the function of habits. This framework promises to illuminate many other realms of social life previously considered off-limits by economists.",

            "description": "In 2006, hedge fund manager John Paulson realized something few others suspected--that the housing market and the value of subprime mortgages were grossly inflated and headed for a major fall. \u00a0Paulson's background was in mergers and acquisitions, however, and he knew little about real estate or how to wager against housing. \u00a0He had spent a career as an also-ran on Wall Street. But Paulson was convinced this was his chance to make his mark. He just wasn't sure how to do it. \u00a0Colleagues at investment banks scoffed at him and investors dismissed him. \u00a0Even pros skeptical about housing shied away from the complicated derivative investments that Paulson was just learning about. \u00a0But Paulson and a handful of renegade investors such as Jeffrey Greene and Michael Burry began to bet heavily against risky mortgages and precarious financial companies. Timing is everything, though. Initially, Paulson and the others lost tens of millions of dollars as real estate and stocks continued to soar. Rather than back down, however, Paulson redoubled his bets, putting his hedge fund and his reputation on the line. \u00a0 \u00a0 In the summer of 2007, the markets began to implode, bringing Paulson early profits, but also sparking efforts to rescue real estate and derail him. By year's end, though, John Paulson had pulled off the greatest trade in financial history, earning more than $15 billion for his firm--a figure that dwarfed George Soros's billion-dollar currency trade in 1992. \u00a0Paulson made billions more in 2008 by transforming his gutsy move. \u00a0Some of the underdog investors who attempted the daring trade also reaped fortunes. But others who got the timing wrong met devastating failure, discovering that being early and right wasn't nearly enough. \u00a0 \u00a0 Written by the prizewinning reporter who broke the story in The Wall Street Journal, The Greatest Trade Ever is a superbly written, fast-paced, behind-the-scenes narrative of how a contrarian foresaw an escalating financial crisis--that outwitted Chuck Prince, Stanley O'Neal, Richard Fuld, and Wall Street's titans--to make financial history.",

            "description": "Since he began selling his hand-sewn t-shirts on the streets of Queens, Daymond John has been exercising the power of broke. With little money and only $40 to work with, Daymond had to go outside the box to sell his items. Fortunately, desperation creates creativity, and he came up with a concept for a creative campaign that would eventually turn the FUBU brand into a $6 billion global phenomenon. But it might not have occurred if he hadn't started off penniless, with nothing but a hopeful heart and a burning desire to succeed by any means necessary.The inventor of FUBU and star of ABC's Shark Tank demonstrates how, rather than being a disadvantage, being broke can be your greatest competitive edge as an entrepreneur. Why? Because establishing a business on a shoestring drives you to be more inventive. It forces you to make better use of your resources. It forces you to engage more authentically with your customers and advertise your ideas in new ways. It requires you to be true to yourself, stay laser-focused on your objectives, and come up with the creative solutions needed to leave a lasting impression.When you're up against the wall, your money account is depleted, and your only resources are imagination and passion, success is your only alternative. You'll learn how to use the Power of Broke to scrape, hustle, and dream your way to the top in this book.",

With the passage of time, Supermoney has, if anything, added to its power to inspire, arouse, provoke, motivate, inform, illuminate, entertain, and guide a whole new generation of readers, while marvelously reprising the global money show for earlier fans.\"-David M. Darst, author of The Art of Asset Allocation Managing Director and Chief Investment Strategist, Morgan Stanley Individual Investor Group\"Nobody has written about the craft of money management with more insight, humor, and understanding than Adam Smith. Over the years, he has consistently separated wisdom from whimsy, brilliance from bluster, and character from chicanery.\"-Byron R. Wien, coauthor of Soros on Soros Chief Investment Strategist, Pequot Capital ManagementSupermoney may be even more relevant today than it was over twenty-five years ago when it was originally published. This book, written in Adam Smith's usual colorful and amusing manner, provides an inside look into institutions, experts, and the structure of markets that has seldom been seen before or since. \"Adam Smith\" was the first to mention Warren Buffett, an unknown Omaha, Nebraska fund manager. In this new version, Smith offers a fresh viewpoint in an updated Preface that contextualizes the 1960s and 1970s markets' applicability to today's marketplaces. Things change, but they don't always change for the better.\u200d",

            "description": "\"Why do we think governments know how to create money? They don't. George Gilder shows that money is time, and time is real. He is our best guide to our most fundamental economic problem.\" \u00a0--Peter Thiel, founder of PayPal and Palantir Technologies\"Thirty-five years ago, George Gilder wrote Wealth and Poverty, the bible of the Reagan Revolution. With The Scandal of Money he may have written the road map to the next big boom.\" \u00a0--Arthur B. Laffer, coauthor of the New York Times bestseller An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of States\"Gilder pushes us to think about the government monopoly on money and makes a strong case against it. If you believe in economic freedom, you should read this book.\" --Senator Jim DeMint, president of The Heritage FoundationAs famed economist and New York Times bestselling author George Gilder points out, \u201cdespite multi-billion dollar stimulus packages and near-zero interest rates, Wall Street recovers but the economy never does.\u201dIn his groundbreaking new book, The Scandal of Money, Gilder unveils a radical new explanation for our economic woes. \u00a0Gilder also exposes the corruption of the Federal Reserve, Washington power-brokers, and Wall Street\u2019s \u201ctoo-big-to-fail\u201d megabanks, detailing how a small cabal of elites have manipulated currencies and crises to stifle economic growth and crush the middle class.Gilder spares no one in his devastating attack on politicians\u2019 economic policies. \u00a0He claims that the Democrats will steer us to ruin \u2013 but points out that Republicans are also woefully misguided on how to salvage our economic future. \u00a0With all major polls showing that voters rank the economy as one of the top three \u201cmost important problems\u201d facing the nation, Gilder\u2019s myth-busting, paradigm-shifting recipe for economic growth could not come at a more critical time.In The Scandal of Money, the reader will learn:Who is to blame for the economic crippling of AmericaHow the new titans of Wall Street value volatility over profitabilityWhy China is winning and we are losingWho the real 1% is and how they are crushing the middle classThe hidden dangers of a cashless societyWhat Republicans need to do to win the economic debate\u2014and what the Democrats are doing to make things worse",

            "description": "They deliver more capital to entrepreneurs than any other source. And they often receive an incredible return on their investments. They\u2019re angel investors, some of the most important\u2014and least understood\u2014players in business today, whose investments in startups exceed $20 billion per year. Many, if not most, of the world\u2019s largest companies were originally funded by angels\u2014companies like Apple, Microsoft, LinkedIn and Amazon.com.But until now, little has been written about these angels, due in part to their preference for anonymity. ANGEL INVESTING: The Gust Guide to Making Money and Having Fun Investing in Startups by David S. Rose provides an inside look at who these angels are, how they operate, and how anyone with six figures to invest can potentially generate annual returns of 25% while funding tomorrow\u2019s industry leaders\u2026and having a lot of fun in the process.In the past few years, angel investing has moved from an arcane, tiny backwater of the financial world to a business arena that receives coverage in mainstream newspapers and smash hit television shows such as ABC\u2019s Shark Tank. Every year angels invest over $20 billion into startup companies in the US alone (and double that amount worldwide). Historically this been a virtually random activity, but over the past several years angel investing has begun to be recognized as a legitimate part of the Alternative Investments asset class.With a foreword by Reid Hoffman\u2014co-founder of LinkedIn and a prolific angel investor himself\u2014together with hard research studies and a host of stories from his personal experience as one of the world\u2019s leading angels, Rose explains in this book precisely how angels and venture capitalists differ, describes proven ways for entrepreneurs to attract them, and provides all the relevant resources for investors to enter into the world of startup funding.",

            "description": "In his best-selling \"Irrational Exuberance,\" Robert Shiller cautioned that society's obsession with the stock market was fueling the volatility that has since made a roller coaster of the financial system. Less noted was Shiller's admonition that our infatuation with the stock market distracts us from more durable economic prospects. These lie in the hidden potential of real assets, such as income from our livelihoods and homes. But these ''ordinary riches, '' so fundamental to our well-being, are increasingly exposed to the pervasive risks of a rapidly changing global economy. This compelling and important new book presents a fresh vision for hedging risk and securing our economic future.Shiller describes six fundamental ideas for using modern information technology and advanced financial theory to temper basic risks that have been ignored by risk management institutions--risks to the value of our jobs and our homes, to the vitality of our communities, and to the very stability of national economies. Informed by a comprehensive risk information database, this new financial order would include global markets for trading risks and exploiting myriad new financial opportunities, from inequality insurance to intergenerational social security. Just as developments in insuring risks to life, health, and catastrophe have given us a quality of life unimaginable a century ago, so Shiller's plan for securing crucial assets promises to substantially enrich our condition.Once again providing an enormous service, Shiller gives us a powerful means to convert our ordinary riches into a level of economic security, equity, and growth never before seen. And once again, what Robert Shiller says should be read and heeded by anyone with a stake in the economy.",

            "description": "The ultimate pioneering blueprint for understanding the blockchain's what, why, and how.Blockchains are new technological layers that are rewiring the Internet and threatening to displace existing legacy structures and enterprises that rely on centralization. At its heart, a blockchain instils confidence in a network, obviating the need for some intermediaries and upsetting their business models in the process. Blockchains are the ultimate non-stop computers, metaphorically speaking. They are trustworthy and desirable for hosting a new generation of decentralized services and software applications since they never go down once they are deployed and offer an extraordinary level of resiliency.The Business Blockchain breaks new ground in furthering our understanding of the blockchain by dissecting its components in a way that no other book has done before. William Mougayar envisions a future in which there will be hundreds, if not millions, of blockchains, allowing for not just frictionless value exchange but also a new flow of value, changing roles, relationships, power, and government. Mougayar offers two more strategic assumptions in this work. For starters, the blockchain has polymorphic properties, which means that its implementation will have a variety of impacts. Second, we should avoid asking what issues the blockchain answers since this limits our understanding of its possibilities. Rather, we should envision new possibilities and take on even more ambitious issues that cut over organizational, regulatory, and emotional barriers.",

Masters of Corporate Venture Capital is packed with invaluable advice about how to best raise capital from CVCs, unlock synergies of partnering startups with large corporations for rapid international growth and avoid potential disasters and other dangers related to CVC.More than 20% of all Venture Capital financings include at least one CVC and thus startups need to understand this previously misunderstood area of funding.Corporations need to establish their own CVC arms to access external innovation and learn how to bring this inside via VC investing, partnerships and M&A. We work in a very complex ecosystem and this book captures stories that bring the complexity to life with simple lessons.",

            "description": "The Wall Street Journal's award-winning business reporter unveils the bizarre and sinister story of how a math genius named Tom Hayes, a handful of outrageous confederates, and a deeply corrupt banking system ignited one of the greatest financial scandals in history. The paperback edition includes a new chapter discussing further fallout from the scandal.In 2006, an oddball group of bankers, traders and brokers from some of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions made a startling realization: Libor\u2014the London interbank offered rate, which determines interest rates on trillions in loans worldwide\u2014was set daily by a small group of easily manipulated functionaries. Tom Hayes, a brilliant but troubled mathematician, became the lynchpin of shadowy team that used hook and crook to take over the process and set rates that made them a fortune, no matter the cost to others. Among the motley crew was a French trader nicknamed \u201cGollum\u201d; the broker \u201cAbbo,\u201d who liked to publicly strip naked when drinking; a Kazakh chicken farmer turned something short of financial whiz kid; an executive called \u201cClumpy\u201d because of his patchwork hair loss; and a broker uncreatively nicknamed \u201cBig Nose.\u201d Eventually known as the \u201cSpider Network,\u201d Hayes\u2019s circle generated untold riches \u2014until it all unraveled in spectacularly vicious, backstabbing fashion.Praised as reading \u201clike a fast-paced John le Carr\u00e9 thriller\u201d (New York Times), \u201ccompelling\u201d (Washington Post) and \u201cjaw-dropping\u201d (Financial Times), The Spider Network is not only a rollicking account of the scam, but a provocative examination of a financial system that was warped and shady throughout.",

His straight talk about the ways of stockbrokers (they are salesmen, plain and simple), corporate financial statements (the truth is often hidden), mutual fund managers (remember who they really work for), and other aspects of the business will help to arm everyone with the tools they need to protect\u2014and enhance\u2014their financial future.",

            "description": "Using the letters Warren Buffett wrote to his partners between 1956 and 1970, a veteran financial advisor presents the renowned guru\u2019s \u201cground rules\u201d for investing\u2014guidelines that remain startlingly relevant today.In the fourteen years between his time in New York with value-investing guru Benjamin Graham and his start as chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett managed Buffett Partnership Limited, his first professional investing partnership. Over the course of that time\u2014a period in which he experienced an unprecedented record of success\u2014Buffett wrote semiannual letters to his small but growing group of partners, sharing his thoughts, approaches, and reflections.Compiled for the first time and with Buffett\u2019s permission, the letters spotlight his contrarian diversification strategy, his almost religious celebration of compounding interest, his preference for conservative rather than conventional decision making, and his goal and tactics for bettering market results by at least 10% annually. Demonstrating Buffett\u2019s intellectual rigor, they provide a framework to the craft of investing that had not existed before: Buffett built upon the quantitative contributions made by his famous teacher, Benjamin Graham, demonstrating how they could be applied and improved.Jeremy Miller reveals how these letters offer us a rare look into Buffett\u2019s mind and offer accessible lessons in control and discipline\u2014effective in bull and bear markets alike, and in all types of investing climates\u2014that are the bedrock of his success. Warren Buffett\u2019s Ground Rules paints a portrait of the sage as a young investor during a time when he developed the long-term value-oriented strategy that helped him build the foundation of his wealth\u2014rules for success every investor needs today.",

An enduring masterpiece of investigative journalism by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar, it includes a new afterword by the authors that brings this remarkable story of greed and double-dealings up to date twenty years after the famed deal. The Los Angeles Times calls Barbarians at the Gate, \u201cSuperlative.\u201d The Chicago Tribune raves, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a better story...and it\u2019s hard to imagine a better account.\u201d And in an era of spectacular business crashes and federal bailouts, it still stands as a valuable cautionary tale that must be heeded.",

            "description": "This book is a first-person description of life during the Great Depression, with chilling similarities to our own day.Benjamin Roth was born in 1894 in New York City. He had been practising law for around ten years when the stock market fell in 1929, primarily representing small firms. He began writing down his views in a diary that he kept intermittently until his death in 1978, about two years after he began to understand the significance of what had occurred to American economic life.Roth's comments from that era appear to speak straight to today's readers. His views and experiences have a startling resemblance to those of our own day. Roth, like many of us, strives to comprehend and educate himself on the events unfolding around him. He is a sceptic of large government, but FDR's New Deal eventually wins him over. This compilation of his journal entries, edited by James Ledbetter, editor of Slate's \"The Big Money,\" offers a different aspect of the Great Depression: that of regular, middle-class people dealing with a rapidly changing economy and fear about the uncertain future on a daily basis. It's quite current - and timely.Many Americans are wondering how things were like when the Great Depression developed and no one knew how or when it would end, thanks to the worst financial calamity since the Great Depression. It's bright-eyed, readable, and strangely familiar.From the drop in the price of movie tickets to Hoover's failed free-market solutions, to the rise in foreclosures in his hometown and how to profit from 'bargains' at the much-diminished stock exchange, Roth chronicles the most telling moments of the Great Depression in short, concise, and thoughtful entries. It was released one year after Lehman Brothers' failure threw global markets into a tailspin, and on the 80th anniversary of \"Black Tuesday.\"",

            "description": "What is a business for? On day one of an economics course a new student is taught the answer: to maximize shareholder profit. But this single idea that pervades all our thinking about the role of the corporation, is fundamentally wrong, argues Colin Mayer. Constraining the firm to a single narrow objective has had wide-ranging and damaging consequences; economic, environmental, political, and social.\u200dProsperity challenges the fundamentals of business thinking. It also sets out a positive new agenda, demonstrating that the corporation is in a unique and powerful position to promote economic and social wellbeing in its fullest sense, for customers, for future generations, as well as for shareholders.Professor and former Dean of the Sa\u00efd Business School in Oxford, Mayer is a leading figure in the global discussion about the purpose and role of the corporation. In Prosperity, he presents a radical and carefully considered agenda for corporations themselves, and for the regulatory frameworks that will enable them to do this. Drawing together insights from business, law, and economics, science, philosophy, and history, he shows how the corporation can realize its full potential to contribute to the economic and social wellbeing of the many, not just the few.\u200dProsperity is as much a discussion of how to create and run successful businesses as it is a guide to policymaking to fix the broken system.",

            "description": "This volume provides the definitive treatment of fortune's formula or the Kelly capital growth criterion as it is often called. The strategy is to maximize long run wealth of the investor by maximizing the period by period expected utility of wealth with a logarithmic utility function. Mathematical theorems show that only the log utility function maximizes asymptotic long run wealth and minimizes the expected time to arbitrary large goals. In general, the strategy is risky in the short term but as the number of bets increase, the Kelly bettor's wealth tends to be much larger than those with essentially different strategies. So most of the time, the Kelly bettor will have much more wealth than these other bettors but the Kelly strategy can lead to considerable losses a small percent of the time.There are ways to reduce this risk at the cost of lower expected final wealth using fractional Kelly strategies that blend the Kelly suggested wager with cash. The various classic reprinted papers and the new ones written specifically for this volume cover various aspects of the theory and practice of dynamic investing. Good and bad properties are discussed, as are fixed-mix and volatility induced growth strategies. The relationships with utility theory and the use of these ideas by great investors are featured.\u200d",

            "description": "The scientific study of complex systems has transformed a wide range of disciplines in recent years, enabling researchers in both the natural and social sciences to model and predict phenomena as diverse as earthquakes, global warming, demographic patterns, financial crises, and the failure of materials. In this book, Didier Sornette boldly applies his varied experience in these areas to propose a simple, powerful, and general theory of how, why, and when stock markets crash.Most attempts to explain market failures seek to pinpoint triggering mechanisms that occur hours, days, or weeks before the collapse. Sornette proposes a radically different view: the underlying cause can be sought months and even years before the abrupt, catastrophic event in the build-up of cooperative speculation, which often translates into an accelerating rise of the market price, otherwise known as a \"bubble.\" Anchoring his sophisticated, step-by-step analysis in leading-edge physical and statistical modeling techniques, he unearths remarkable insights and some predictions--among them, that the \"end of the growth era\" will occur around 2050.",

            "description": "Frederick Lewis Allen was a social historian who was one of the first. Allen is best known for his book Only Yesterday, which pioneered the concept of instant history, or the reconstruction of bygone eras through vivid commentary on news, fashions, rituals, and artefacts that changed the speed and forms of American life. Allen's final and most ambitious work was The Big Change. He tried to chronicle and explain the steady change of American life over the last half-century in it. The Big Change describes a pivotal era in American history and gives an implicit and insightful perspective on what has occurred in the second half of the twentieth century, written during a time of exceptional optimism and wealth.Allen's central topic is the achievement, in large part, of democracy's promise. Allen wrote in favor of an economic system that had ushered in a new era of well-being for the American people, in contrast to the strand of social critique that regarded America as enfeebled by luxury and conformity. He splits his investigation into three areas. The first, \"The Old Order,\" depicts a turn-of-the-century plutocracy in which the federal government was mostly subordinate to economic interests and the wealth disparity foreshadowed a serious threat of bloodshed. \"The Momentum of Change\" depicts the different factors that shaped America in the new century: mass manufacturing, the car, the Great Depression and the rise of large government, World War II, and America's emergence as a world power. In this context, Allen demonstrates how the economic system was altered without being damaged, and how social differences gradually narrowed.\"The New America,\" the last portion, is a positive evaluation of postwar American culture. Allen's study challenges many prevalent views of American society, both foreign and domestic, and puts the country's social issues in context. The Big Change is both a profound and delightfully accessible work of social criticism, as William O'Neill points out in his introduction to this new edition, and a book that gains rather than loses with the passage of time.",

            "description": "Warren Buffett built Berkshire Hathaway into something remarkable\u2014 and Fortune journalist Carol Loomis had a front-row seat for it all.When Carol Loomis first mentioned a little-known Omaha hedge fund manager in a 1966 Fortune article, she didn\u2019t dream that Warren Buffett would one day be considered the world\u2019s greatest investor\u2014nor that she and Buffett would quickly become close personal friends. As Buf\u00adfett\u2019s fortune and reputation grew over time, Loomis used her unique insight into Buffett\u2019s thinking to chronicle his work for Fortune, writ\u00ading and proposing scores of stories that tracked his many accomplishments\u2014and also his occa\u00adsional mistakes.Now Loomis has collected and updated the best Buffett articles Fortune published between 1966 and 2012, including thirteen cover stories and a dozen pieces authored by Buffett himself. Loomis has provided commentary about each major arti\u00adcle that supplies context and her own informed point of view. Readers will gain fresh insights into Buffett\u2019s investment strategies and his thinking on management, philanthropy, public policy, and even parenting. Some of the highlights include:The 1966 A. W. Jones story in which Fortune first mentioned Buffett.The first piece Buffett wrote for the magazine, 1977\u2019s \u201cHow Inf lation Swindles the Equity Investor.\u201dAndrew Tobias\u2019s 1983 article \u201cLetters from Chairman Buffett,\u201d the first review of his Berk\u00adshire Hathaway shareholder letters.Buffett\u2019s stunningly prescient 2003 piece about derivatives, \u201cAvoiding a Mega-Catastrophe.\u201dHis unconventional thoughts on inheritance and philanthropy, including his intention to leave his kids \u201cenough money so they would feel they could do anything, but not so much that they could do nothing.\u201dBill Gates\u2019s 1996 article describing his early impressions of Buffett as they struck up their close friendship.Scores of Buffett books have been written, but none can claim this work\u2019s combination of trust between two friends, the writer\u2019s deep under\u00adstanding of Buffett\u2019s world, and a very long-term perspective.",

            "description": "If you asked most people what forces led to today\u2019s unprecedented income inequality and financial crashes, no one would say the Federal Reserve. For most of its history, the Fed has enjoyed the fawning adoration of the press. When the economy grew, it was credited to the Fed. When the economy imploded in 2008, the Fed got credit for rescuing us.But the Fed also has a unique power to reshape the American economy for the worse, which it did, fatefully, on November 4, 2010 through a radical intervention called quantitative easing. In just a few short years, the Fed more than quadrupled the money supply with one goal: to encourage banks and other investors to extend more risky debt. Leaders at the Fed knew that they were undertaking a bold experiment that would produce few real jobs, with long-term risks that were hard to measure. But the Fed proceeded anyway...and then found itself trapped. Once it printed all that money, there was no way to withdraw it from circulation. The Fed tried several times, only to see market start to crash, at which point the Fed turned the money spigot back on. That\u2019s what it did when COVID hit, printing 300 years\u2019 worth of money in two short months.Which brings us to now: Ten years on, the gap between the rich and poor has grown dramatically, stock prices are trading far above what\u2019s justified by actual corporate profits, corporate debt in America is at an all-time high, and this debt is being traded by big banks on Wall Street, leaving them vulnerable\u2014just as they were during the mortgage boom. Middle-class wages have barely budged in a decade, and consumers are buried under credit card debt, car loan debt, and student debt.\u200dThe Lords of Easy Money tells the shocking, riveting tale of how quantitative easing is imperiling the American economy through the story of the one man who tried to warn us. This will be the first inside story of how we really got here\u2014and why we face a frightening future.",

            "description": "In a time of market volatility and economic uncertainty, when high-frequency traders and hedge fund managers seem to tower over the average investor, Burton G. Malkiel's classic and gimmick-free investment guide is now more necessary than ever. Rather than tricks, what you'll find here is a time-tested and thoroughly research-based strategy for your portfolio. Whether you're considering your first 401(k) contribution or contemplating retirement, this fully updated edition of A Random Walk Down Wall Street should be the first book on your reading list.In A Random Walk Down Wall Street you'll learn the basic terminology of \"The Street\" and how to navigate it with the help of a user-friendly, long-range investment strategy that really works. Drawing on his own varied experience as an economist, financial adviser, and successful investor, Malkiel shows why, despite recent advice to the contrary from so-called experts in the wake of the financial crisis, an individual who buys over time and holds a low-cost, internationally diversified index of securities is still likely to exceed the performance of portfolios carefully picked by professionals using sophisticated analytical techniques. In this new edition, Malkiel has provided valuable new material throughout the book on exchange-traded funds and investment opportunities in emerging markets, and in a brand-new, timely chapter, Malkiel authoritatively assesses the pitfalls and prospects of the latest investing trend, \"smart beta.\"On top of all this, the book's classic life-cycle guide to investing, which tailors strategies to investors of any age, will help you plan confidently for the future. You'll learn how to analyze the potential returns, not only for basic stocks and bonds but for the full range of investment opportunities\u2014from money-market accounts and real estate investment trusts to insurance, home ownership, and tangible assets like gold and collectibles. Individual investors of every level of experience and risk tolerance will find throughout the book the critical facts and step-by-step guidance they need to protect and grow their hard-earned dollars.With the prevailing wisdom changing on an almost daily basis, Malkiel's reassuring and vastly informative volume remains the best investment guide money can buy.",
