            "description": "In this candid and riveting memoir, for the first time ever, Nike founder and board chairman Phil Knight shares the inside story of the company\u2019s early days as an intrepid start-up and its evolution into one of the world\u2019s most iconic, game-changing, and profitable brands.Young, searching, fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed fifty dollars from his father and launched a company with one simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost running shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the trunk of his Plymouth Valiant, Knight grossed eight thousand dollars that first year, 1963. Today, Nike\u2019s annual sales top $30 billion. In this age of start-ups, Knight\u2019s Nike is the gold standard, and its swoosh is more than a logo. A symbol of grace and greatness, it\u2019s one of the few icons instantly recognized in every corner of the world.But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always been a mystery. Now, in a memoir that\u2019s surprising, humble, unfiltered, funny, and beautifully crafted, he tells his story at last. It all begins with a classic crossroads moment. Twenty-four years old, backpacking through Asia and Europe and Africa, wrestling with life\u2019s Great Questions, Knight decides the unconventional path is the only one for him. Rather than work for a big corporation, he will create something all his own, something new, dynamic, different. Knight details the many terrifying risks he encountered along the way, the crushing setbacks, the ruthless competitors, the countless doubters and haters and hostile bankers\u2014as well as his many thrilling triumphs and narrow escapes. Above all, he recalls the foundational relationships that formed the heart and soul of Nike, with his former track coach, the irascible and charismatic Bill Bowerman, and with his first employees, a ragtag group of misfits and savants who quickly became a band of swoosh-crazed brothers.Together, harnessing the electrifying power of a bold vision and a shared belief in the redemptive, transformative power of sports, they created a brand, and a culture, that changed everything.",

            "description": "After decades of research, world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a fixed mindset\u2014those who believe that abilities are fixed\u2014are less likely to flourish than those with a growth mindset\u2014those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment.In this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mindset. She also expands the mindset concept beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mindset, you can motivate those you lead, teach, and love\u2014to transform their lives and your own.",

            "description": "\u201cWhy We Sleep is an important and fascinating book\u2026Walker taught me a lot about this basic activity that every person on Earth needs. I suspect his book will do the same for you.\u201d \u2014Bill GatesA New York Times bestseller and international sensation, this \u201cstimulating and important book\u201d (Financial Times) is a fascinating dive into the purpose and power of slumber.Sleep is one of the most important but least understood aspects of our life, wellness, and longevity. Until very recently, science had no answer to the question of why we sleep, or what good it served, or why we suffer such devastating health consequences when we don't sleep. Compared to the other basic drives in life\u2014eating, drinking, and reproducing\u2014the purpose of sleep remained elusive.An explosion of scientific discoveries in the last twenty years has shed new light on this fundamental aspect of our lives. Now, preeminent neuroscientist and sleep expert Matthew Walker gives us a new understanding of the vital importance of sleep and dreaming. Within the brain, sleep enriches our ability to learn, memorize, and make logical decisions. It recalibrates our emotions, restocks our immune system, fine-tunes our metabolism, and regulates our appetite. Dreaming mollifies painful memories and creates a virtual reality space in which the brain melds past and present knowledge to inspire creativity.Walker answers important questions about sleep: how do caffeine and alcohol affect sleep? What really happens during REM sleep? Why do our sleep patterns change across a lifetime? How do common sleep aids affect us and can they do long-term damage? Charting cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs, and synthesizing decades of research and clinical practice, Walker explains how we can harness sleep to improve learning, mood, and energy levels; regulate hormones; prevent cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, and diabetes; slow the effects of aging; increase longevity; enhance the education and lifespan of our children, and boost the efficiency, success, and productivity of our businesses. Clear-eyed, fascinating, and accessible, Why We Sleep is a crucial and illuminating book.",

            "description": "An updated edition of the blockbuster bestselling leadership book that took America and the world by storm, two U.S. Navy SEAL officers who led the most highly decorated special operations unit of the Iraq War demonstrate how to apply powerful leadership principles from the battlefield to business and life. Now with an excerpt from the authors' new book, THE DICHOTOMY OF LEADERSHIP.Combat, the most intense and dynamic environment imaginable, teaches the toughest leadership lessons, with absolutely everything at stake. Jocko Willink and Leif Babin learned this reality first-hand on the most violent and dangerous battlefield in Iraq. As leaders of SEAL Team Three\u2019s Task Unit Bruiser, their mission was one many thought impossible: help U.S. forces secure Ramadi, a violent, insurgent-held city deemed \u201call but lost.\u201d In gripping, firsthand accounts of heroism, tragic loss, and hard-won victories, they learned that leadership\u2015at every level\u2015is the most important factor in whether a team succeeds or fails.Willink and Babin returned home from deployment and instituted SEAL leadership training to pass on their harsh lessons learned in combat to help forge the next generation of SEAL leaders. After leaving the SEAL Teams, they launched a company, Echelon Front, to teach those same leadership principles to leaders in businesses, companies, and organizations across the civilian sector. Since that time, they have trained countless leaders and worked with hundreds of companies in virtually every industry across the U.S. and internationally, teaching them how to develop their own high-performance teams and most effectively lead those teams to dominate their battlefields.Since it\u2019s release in October 2015, Extreme Ownership has revolutionized leadership development and set a new standard for literature on the subject. Required reading for many of the most successful organizations, it has become an integral part of the official leadership training programs for scores of business teams, military units, and first responders. Detailing the mindset and principles that enable SEAL units to accomplish the most difficult combat missions, Extreme Ownership demonstrates how to apply them to any team or organization, in any leadership environment. A compelling narrative with powerful instruction and direct application, Extreme Ownership challenges leaders everywhere to fulfill their ultimate purpose: lead and win.",

            "description": "From the physician behind the wildly popular website NutritionFacts.org, How Not to Die reveals the groundbreaking scientific evidence behind the only diet that can prevent and reverse many of the causes of disease-related death.The vast majority of premature deaths can be prevented through simple changes in diet and lifestyle. In How Not to Die, Dr. Michael Greger, the internationally-renowned nutrition expert, physician, and founder of NutritionFacts.org, examines the fifteen top causes of premature death in America -- heart disease, various cancers, diabetes, Parkinson's, high blood pressure, and more -- and explains how nutritional and lifestyle interventions can sometimes trump prescription pills and other pharmaceutical and surgical approaches, freeing us to live healthier lives.The simple truth is that most doctors are good at treating acute illnesses but bad at preventing chronic disease. The fifteen leading causes of death claim the lives of 1.6 million Americans annually. This doesn't have to be the case. By following Dr. Greger's advice, all of it backed up by strong scientific evidence, you will learn which foods to eat and which lifestyle changes to make to live longer.History of prostate cancer in your family? Put down that glass of milk and add flaxseed to your diet whenever you can. Have high blood pressure? Hibiscus tea can work better than a leading hypertensive drug-and without the side effects. Fighting off liver disease? Drinking coffee can reduce liver inflammation. Battling breast cancer? Consuming soy is associated with prolonged survival. Worried about heart disease (the number 1 killer in the United States)? Switch to a whole-food, plant-based diet, which has been repeatedly shown not just to prevent the disease but often stop it in its tracks.In addition to showing what to eat to help treat the top fifteen causes of death, How Not to Die includes Dr. Greger's Daily Dozen -- a checklist of the twelve foods we should consume every day. Full of practical, actionable advice and surprising, cutting edge nutritional science, these doctor's orders are just what we need to live longer, healthier lives.",

            "description": "For David Goggins, childhood was a nightmare - poverty, prejudice, and physical abuse colored his days and haunted his nights. But through self-discipline, mental toughness, and hard work, Goggins transformed himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future into a U.S. Armed Forces icon and one of the world's top endurance athletes. The only man in history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events, inspiring Outside magazine to name him The Fittest (Real) Man in America.In Can't Hurt Me, he shares his astonishing life story and reveals that most of us tap into only 40% of our capabilities. Goggins calls this The 40% Rule, and his story illuminates a path that anyone can follow to push past pain, demolish fear, and reach their full potential.",

As he writes: \u201cAging is a disease, and that disease is treatable.\u201dThis book takes us to the frontlines of research many from Dr. David Sinclair\u2019s own lab at Harvard\u2014that demonstrate how we can slow down, or even reverse, aging. The key is activating newly discovered vitality genes, the descendants of an ancient genetic survival circuit that is both the cause of aging and the key to reversing it.",

But do those of us who accept the reality of human-caused climate change truly believe it? If we did, surely we would be roused to act on what we know. Will future generations distinguish between those who didn\u2019t believe in the science of global warming and those who said they accepted the science but failed to change their lives in response?In We Are the Weather, Jonathan Safran Foer explores the central global dilemma of our time in a surprising, deeply personal, and urgent new way. The task of saving the planet will involve a great reckoning with ourselves\u2014with our all-too-human reluctance to sacrifice immediate comfort for the sake of the future. We have, he reveals, turned our planet into a farm for growing animal products, and the consequences are catastrophic. Only collective action will save our home and way of life. And it all starts with what we eat\u2014and don\u2019t eat\u2014for breakfast.",

Andre Agassi had his life mapped out for him before he left the crib.Groomed to be a tennis champion by his moody and demanding father, by the age of twenty-two Agassi had won the first of his eight grand slams and achieved wealth, celebrity, and the game\u2019s highest honors. But as he reveals in this searching autobiography, off the court he was often unhappy and confused, unfulfilled by his great achievements in a sport he had come to resent.Agassi writes candidly about his early success and his uncomfortable relationship with fame, his marriage to Brooke Shields, his growing interest in philanthropy, and\u2014described in haunting, point-by-point detail\u2014the highs and lows of his celebrated career.",

            "description": "Jonathan Safran Foer spent much of his life oscillating between enthusiastic carnivore and occasional vegetarian. Once he started a family, the moral dimensions of food became increasingly important.Faced with the prospect of being unable to explain why we eat some animals and not others, Foer set out to explore the origins of many eating traditions and the fictions involved with creating them. Traveling to the darkest corners of our dining habits, Foer raises the unspoken question behind every fish we eat, every chicken we fry, and every burger we grill.Part memoir and part investigative report, Eating Animals is a book that, in the words of the Los Angeles Times, places Jonathan Safran Foer \"at the table with our greatest philosophers.\"",

            "description": "#1 New York Times Bestseller from the author of How to Change Your Mind, The Omnivore's Dilemma, and Food Rules.Food. There's plenty of it around, and we all love to eat it. So why should anyone need to defend it?Because in the so-called Western diet, food has been replaced by nutrients, and common sense by confusion--most of what we\u2019re consuming today is longer the product of nature but of food science. The result is what Michael Pollan calls the American Paradox: The more we worry about nutrition, the less healthy we see to become. With In Defense of Food, Pollan proposes a new (and very old) answer to the question of what we should eat that comes down to seven simple but liberating words: \"Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.\" Pollan\u2019s bracing and eloquent manifesto shows us how we can start making thoughtful food choices that will enrich our lives, enlarge our sense of what it means to be healthy, and bring pleasure back to eating.\"Michael Pollan [is the] designated repository for the nation's food conscience.\"\u2014Frank Bruni, The New York Times\" A remarkable volume . . . engrossing . . . [Pollan] offers those prescriptions Americans so desperately crave.\"\u2014The Washington Post\"A tough, witty, cogent rebuttal to the proposition that food can be redced to its nutritional components without the loss of something essential... [a] lively, invaluable book.\"\u2014Janet Maslin, The New York Times\"In Defense of Food is written with Pollan's customary bite, ringing clarity and brilliance at connecting the dots.\"\u2014The Seattle TimesMichael Pollan\u2019s most recent food book Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation--the story of our most trusted food expert\u2019s culinary education--was published by Penguin Press in April 2013, and in 2016 it served as the inspiration for a four-part docuseries on Netflix by the same name.Pollan is also the author of How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence",

            "description": "The science is clear. The results are unmistakable.You can dramatically reduce your risk of cancer, heart disease, and diabetes just by changing your diet.More than 30 years ago, nutrition researcher T. Colin Campbell and his team at Cornell, in partnership with teams in China and England, embarked upon the China Study, the most comprehensive study ever undertaken of the relationship between diet and the risk of developing disease. What they found when combined with findings in Colin\u2019s laboratory, opened their eyes to the dangers of a diet high in animal protein and the unparalleled health benefits of a whole foods, plant-based diet.In 2005, Colin and his son Tom, now a physician, shared those findings with the world in The China Study, hailed as one of the most important books about diet and health ever written.Featuring brand new content, this heavily expanded edition of Colin and Tom\u2019s groundbreaking book includes the latest undeniable evidence of the power of a plant-based diet, plus updated information about the changing medical system and how patients stand to benefit from a surging interest in plant-based nutrition.The China Study\u2014Revised and Expanded Edition presents a clear and concise message of hope as it dispels a multitude of health myths and misinformation. The basic message is clear. The key to a long, healthy life lies in three things: breakfast, lunch, and dinner.",

            "description": "The New York Times bestseller \u2013 with a new afterword added to the paperback \u2013 from the author of Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World.In high school, I wondered whether the Jamaican Americans who made our track team so successful might carry some special speed gene from their tiny island. In college, I ran against Kenyans, and wondered whether endurance genes might have traveled with them from East Africa. At the same time, I began to notice that a training group on my team could consist of five men who run next to one another, stride for stride, day after day, and nonetheless turn out five entirely different runners. How could this be?We all knew a star athlete in high school. The one who made it look so easy. He was the starting quarterback and shortstop; she was the all-state point guard and high-jumper. Naturals. Or were they?The debate is as old as physical competition. Are stars like Usain Bolt, Michael Phelps, and Serena Williams genetic freaks put on Earth to dominate their respective sports? Or are they simply normal people who overcame their biological limits through sheer force of will and obsessive training?The truth is far messier than a simple dichotomy between nature and nurture. In the decade since the sequencing of the human genome, researchers have slowly begun to uncover how the relationship between biological endowments and a competitor\u2019s training environment affects athleticism. Sports scientists have gradually entered the era of modern genetic research.In this controversial and engaging exploration of athletic success, Sports Illustrated senior writer David Epstein tackles the great nature vs. nurture debate and traces how far science has come in solving this great riddle. He investigates the so-called 10,000-hour rule to uncover whether rigorous and consistent practice from a young age is the only route to athletic excellence.Along the way, Epstein dispels many of our perceptions about why top athletes excel. He shows why some skills that we assume are innate, like the bullet-fast reactions of a baseball or cricket batter, are not, and why other characteristics that we assume are entirely voluntary, like an athlete\u2019s will to train, might in fact have important genetic components.This subject necessarily involves digging deep into sensitive topics like race and gender. Epstein explores controversial questions such as:Are black athletes genetically predetermined to dominate both sprinting and distance running, and are their abilities influenced by Africa\u2019s geography?Are there genetic reasons to separate male and female athletes in competition?Should we test the genes of young children to determine if they are destined for stardom?Can genetic testing determine who is at risk of injury, brain damage, or even death on the field?Through on-the-ground reporting from below the equator and above the Arctic Circle, revealing conversations with leading scientists and Olympic champions, and interviews with athletes who have rare genetic mutations or physical traits, Epstein forces us to rethink the very nature of athleticism.",

Yet despite this advice, we have seen unprecedented epidemics of obesity and diabetes. Taubes argues that the problem lies in refined carbohydrates, like white flour, easily digested starches, and sugars, and that the key to good health is the kind of calories we take in, not the number.Called \u201ca very important book,\u201d by Andrew Weil and \u2026\u201d destined to change the way we think about food,\u201d by Michael Pollan,  this groundbreaking book by award-winning science writer Gary Taubes shows us that almost everything we believe about the nature of a healthy diet is wrong.",

Loaded with calories, fat, and cholesterol, cheese can make you gain weight and leads to a host of health problems like high blood pressure and arthritis. Worse, it contains mild opiates that make it additive, triggering the same brain receptors as heroin and morphine. In THE CHEESE TRAP, Dr. Neal Barnard presents a comprehensive program to help readers break free of their cheese addiction so they can lose weight, boost energy, and improve their overall health. This easy-to-follow diet features a treasury of healthy recipes that will tame even the toughest cravings-from pizza, to lasagna, to ice cream and cheesecake.",

In a riveting narrative, award-winning journalist and often-injured runner Christopher McDougall sets out to discover their secrets. In the process, he takes his readers from science labs at Harvard to the sun-baked valleys and freezing peaks across North America, where ever-growing numbers of ultra-runners are pushing their bodies to the limit, and, finally, to a climactic race in the Copper Canyons that pits America\u2019s best ultra-runners against the tribe. McDougall\u2019s incredible story will not only engage your mind but inspire your body when you realize that you, indeed all of us, were born to run.",

            "description": "Finding Ultra is an incredible but true account of achieving one of the most awe-inspiring midlife physical transformations ever.On the night before he was to turn forty, Rich Roll experienced a chilling glimpse of his future. Nearly fifty pounds overweight and unable to climb the stairs without stopping, he could see where his current sedentary life was taking him\u2014and he woke up.Plunging into a new routine that prioritized a plant-based lifestyle and daily training, Rich morphed\u2014in a matter of mere months\u2014from out of shape, mid-life couch potato to endurance machine. Finding Ultra recounts Rich\u2019s remarkable journey to the starting line of the elite Ultraman competition, which pits the world\u2019s fittest humans in a 320-mile ordeal of swimming, biking, and running. And following that test, Rich conquered an even greater one: the EPIC5\u2014five Ironman-distance triathlons, each on a different Hawaiian island, all completed in less than a week.In the years since Finding Ultra was published, Rich has become one of the world\u2019s most recognized advocates of plant-based living. In this newly revised and updated edition, he shares the practices, tools, and techniques he uses for optimal performance, longevity, and wellness, including diet and nutrition protocols. Rich reflects on the steps he took to shift his mindset and leverage deep reservoirs of untapped potential to achieve success beyond his wildest imagination, urging each of us to embark on our own journey of self-discovery.",

            "description": "The standout memoir from NBA powerhouse Andre Iguodala, the indomitable sixth man of the champion Golden State Warriors.Andre Iguodala is one of the most admired players in the NBA. And fresh off the Warriors' third NBA championship in the last four years, his game has never been stronger.Off the court, Iguodala has earned respect, too--for his successful tech investments, his philanthropy, and increasingly for his contributions to the conversation about race in America. It is no surprise, then, that in his first book, Andre--with his cowriter Carvell Wallace--has pushed himself to go further than he ever has before about his life, not only as an athlete but about what makes him who he is at his core.The Sixth Man traces Andre's journey from childhood in his Illinois hometown to his Bay Area home court today. Basketball has always been there. But this is the story, too, of his experience of the conflict and racial tension always at hand in a professional league made up largely of African American men; of whether and why the athlete owes the total sacrifice of his body; of the relationship between competition and brotherhood among the players of one of history's most glorious championship teams. And of what motivates an athlete to keep striving for more once they've already achieved the highest level of play they could have dreamed.On drive, on leadership, on pain, on accomplishment, on the shame of being given a role, and the glory of taking a role on: This is a powerful memoir of life and basketball that reveals new depths to the superstar athlete, and offers tremendous insight into most urgent stories being told in American society today.",

            "description": "No matter what you eat, how much you exercise, how skinny or young or wise you are, none of it matters if you're not breathing properly.There is nothing more essential to our health and well-being than breathing: take air in, let it out, repeat 25,000 times a day. Yet, as a species, humans have lost the ability to breathe correctly, with grave consequences.Journalist James Nestor travels the world to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it. The answers aren't found in pulmonology labs, as we might expect, but in the muddy digs of ancient burial sites, secret Soviet facilities, New Jersey choir schools, and the smoggy streets of S\ufffdo Paulo. Nestor tracks down men and women exploring the hidden science behind ancient breathing practices like Pranayama, Sudarshan Kriya, and Tummo and teams up with pulmonary tinkerers to scientifically test long-held beliefs about how we breathe.Modern research is showing us that making even slight adjustments to the way we inhale and exhale can jump-start athletic performance; rejuvenate internal organs; halt snoring, asthma, and autoimmune disease; and even straighten scoliotic spines. None of this should be possible, and yet it is.Drawing on thousands of years of medical texts and recent cutting-edge studies in pulmonology, psychology, biochemistry, and human physiology, Breath turns the conventional wisdom of what we thought we knew about our most basic biological function on its head. You will never breathe the same again.",

            "description": "'A clear and engaging explanation of one of the hottest fields in science' Steven PinkerOne of the world's top behavioural geneticists argues that we need a radical rethink about what makes us who we areThe blueprint for our individuality lies in the 1% of DNA that differs between people. Our intellectual capacity, our introversion or extraversion, our vulnerability to mental illness, even whether we are a morning person - all of these aspects of our personality are profoundly shaped by our inherited DNA differences.In Blueprint, Robert Plomin, a pioneer in the field of behavioural genetics, draws on a lifetime's worth of research to make the case that DNA is the most important factor shaping who we are. Our families, schools and the environment around us are important, but they are not as influential as our genes. This is why, he argues, teachers and parents should accept children for who they are, rather than trying to mould them in certain directions. Even the environments we choose and the signal events that impact our lives, from divorce to addiction, are influenced by our genetic predispositions. Now, thanks to the DNA revolution, it is becoming possible to predict who we will become, at birth, from our DNA alone. As Plomin shows us, these developments have sweeping implications for how we think about parenting, education, and social mobility.A game-changing book by a leader in the field, Blueprint shows how the DNA present in the single cell with which we all begin our lives can impact our behaviour as adults.",

            "description": "The internationally renowned, clinically tested, revolutionary diet program to lose weight, fight disease, and live a longer, healthier life.Can what you eat determine how long, and how well, you live? The clinically proven answer is yes, and The Longevity Diet is easier to follow than you'd think. The culmination of 25 years of research on aging, nutrition, and disease across the globe, this unique program lays out a simple solution to living to a healthy old age through nutrition. The key is combining the healthy everyday eating plan the book outlines, with the scientifically engineered fasting-mimicking diet, or FMD; the FMD, done just 3-4 times a year, does away with the misery and starvation most of us experience while fasting, allowing you to reap all the beneficial health effects of a restrictive diet, while avoiding negative stressors, like low energy and sleeplessness.Valter Longo, director of the Longevity Institute at USC and the Program on Longevity and Cancer at IFOM in Milan, designed the FMD after making a series of remarkable discoveries in mice, then in humans, indicating that specific diets can activate stem cells and promote regeneration and rejuvenation in multiple organs to significantly reduce risk for diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, and heart disease. Longo\u2019s simple pescatarian daily eating plan and the periodic fasting-mimicking techniques can both yield impressive results. Low in proteins and sugars and rich in healthy fats and plant-based foods, The Longevity Diet is proven to help you: Lose weight and reduce abdominal fatExtend your healthy lifespan with simple everyday changesPrevent age-related muscle and bone lossBuild your resistance to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's and cancerLongo\u2019s healthy, life span-extending program is based on an easy-to-adopt pescatarian plan along with the fasting-mimicking diet no more than 4 times a year, just 5 days at a time. Including 30 easy recipes for an everyday diet based on Longo's five pillars of longevity, The Longevity Diet is the key to living a longer, healthier, more fulfilled life.",

Lunch gets some love, too.For years, she\u2019s been collecting, cooking, and Instagramming her favorite recipes, and here they are: from breakfast all day to John\u2019s famous fried chicken with spicy honey butter to her mom\u2019s Thai classics.Salty, spicy, saucy, and fun as sin (that\u2019s the food, but that\u2019s Chrissy, too), these dishes are for family, for date night at home, for party time, and for a few life-sucks moments (salads). You\u2019ll learn the importance of chili peppers, the secret to cheesy-cheeseless eggs, and life tips like how to use bacon as a home fragrance, the single best way to wake up in the morning, and how not to overthink men or Brussels sprouts. Because for Chrissy Teigen, cooking, eating, life, and love are one and the same.",

In The Botany of Desire, Michael Pollan ingeniously demonstrates how people and domesticated plants have formed a similarly reciprocal relationship. He masterfully links four fundamental human desires\u2014sweetness, beauty, intoxication, and control\u2014with the plants that satisfy them: the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. In telling the stories of four familiar species, Pollan illustrates how the plants have evolved to satisfy humankind\u2019s most basic yearnings. And just as we\u2019ve benefited from these plants, we have also done well by them. So who is really domesticating whom?",

            "description": "Charles Graeber, New York Times bestselling author of The Good Nurse, details the astonishing scientific discovery of the code to unleashing the human immune system to fight -- and possibly even cure -- cancer, featuring interviews with 2018 Nobel Prize in Medicine award-winners James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo.For decades, scientists have puzzled over one of medicine's most confounding mysteries: Why doesn't our immune system recognize and fight cancer the way it does other diseases, like the common cold?As it turns out, the answer to that question can be traced to a series of tricks that cancer has developed to turn off normal immune responses-tricks that scientists have only recently discovered and learned to defeat. The result is what many are calling cancer's \"penicillin moment,\" a revolutionary discovery in our understanding of cancer and how to beat it.In THE BREAKTHROUGH, Graeber guides readers through the revolutionary scientific research bringing immunotherapy out of the realm of the miraculous and into the forefront of twenty-first-century medical science. As advances in the fields of cancer research and the human immune system continue to fuel a therapeutic arms race among biotech and pharmaceutical research centers around the world, the next step-harnessing the wealth of new information to create modern and more effective patient therapies-is unfolding at an unprecedented pace, rapidly redefining our relationship with this all-too-human disease.Groundbreaking, riveting, and expertly told, THE BREAKTHROUGH is the story of the game-changing scientific discoveries that unleash our natural ability to recognize and defeat cancer, as told through the experiences of the patients, physicians, and cancer immunotherapy researchers who are on the front lines. This is the incredible true story of the race to find a cure, a dispatch from the life-changing world of modern oncological science, and a brave new chapter in medical history.",

            "description": "An intimate look at writing, running, and the incredible way they intersect, What I Talk About When I Talk About Running is an illuminating glimpse into the solitary passions of one of our greatest artists.While training for the New York City Marathon, Haruki Murakami decided to keep a journal of his progress. The result is a memoir about his intertwined obsessions with running and writing, full of vivid recollections and insights, including the eureka moment when he decided to become a writer. By turns funny and sobering, playful and philosophical, here is a rich and revelatory work that elevates the human need for motion to an art form.",

He takes up football, and school, after a rich, white, Evangelical family plucks him from the streets. Then two great forces alter Oher: the family\u2019s love and the evolution of professional football itself into a game where the quarterback must be protected at any cost.

If you\u2019ve ever experienced jet lag or pulled an all-nighter, you know that this schedule can easily be thrown off kilter. But for some people, that imbalance\u2014difficulty sleeping at night, hunger at odd times, or sudden fatigue at noon\u2014is a constant.

To understand how, McDougall retraces their steps across the island that birthed Herakles and Odysseus, and discovers ancient techniques for endurance, sustenance, and natural movement that have been preserved in unique communities around the world.His search takes us scrambling over rooftops with a Parkour crew in London, foraging for greens with a ballerina in Brooklyn, tossing heavy pieces of driftwood on a Brazilian beach with the creator of MovNat\u2014and, finally, to our own backyards. Natural Born Heroes will inspire readers to unleash the extraordinary potential of the human body and climb, swim, skip, throw, and jump their way to heroic feats.",

            "description": "In 2001, Fast Food Nation was published to critical acclaim and became an international bestseller. Eric Schlosser\u2019s expos\u00e9 revealed how the fast food industry has altered the landscape of America, widened the gap between rich and poor, fueled an epidemic of obesity, and transformed food production throughout the world. The book changed the way millions of people think about what they eat and helped to launch today\u2019s food movement.In a new afterword for this edition, Schlosser discusses the growing interest in local and organic food, the continued exploitation of poor workers by the food industry, and the need to ensure that every American has access to good, healthy, affordable food. Fast Food Nation is as relevant today as it was a decade ago. The book inspires readers to look beneath the surface of our food system, consider its impact on society and, most of all, think for themselves.",

She proposes that we cannot immunize our children or ourselves against the world, based on her personal experience as a new mother. Biss expands her chats with other moms to musings on the tale of Achilles, Voltaire's Candide, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, Susan Sontag's AIDS and Its Metaphors, and more as she investigates the metaphors surrounding immunity. On Immunity is both an antidote to fear and a touching description of how we are all intertwined\u2014bodies and futures.\u200d",

            "description": "Why the global drop in infectious illnesses isn't all good news.Plagues and parasites have shaped the creation of the modern state, the expansion of cities, and the unequal fortunes of national economies throughout the world. This book relates that narrative, but it isn't about pestilence reappearing. It tells the tale of its demise. Viruses, bacteria, and other infectious illnesses are not the primary cause of death or disability in any part of the world for the first time in recorded history. People are living longer lives, and fewer moms are giving birth to large families in the hopes that some of their children will survive. However, the news is not all positive. Infectious illness decreases in recent years have not been matched by the same increases in money, employment opportunities, or governance that happened decades ago in wealthier nations. Unintended repercussions have also occurred. Thomas Bollyky analyses the contradiction in our fight against infectious disease in this book: the world is growing healthier in ways that should concern us.Bollyky mixes a sweeping historical narrative about plagues' rise and demise in human cultures with modern case studies of their impacts. Bollyky travels to Dhaka, one of the world's most densely inhabited cities, to demonstrate how low-cost health aids aided the phenomena of third world megacities. He travels to China and Kenya to show how disease decreases have impacted national economies. Bollyky examines the significance of infectious illness in migrations from Ireland before to the potato famine, as well as today's migrations from Africa and other parts of the world to Europe.Historic medical breakthroughs are reshaping a world that is both frightening and full with possibilities. Bollyky emphasises that what we do next will determine whether the danger or promise of such advancement prevails.",

            "description": "A magnificently reported and soulfully crafted exploration of the human immune system\u2013the key to health and wellness, life and death. An epic, first-of-its-kind book, entwining leading-edge scientific discovery with the intimate stories of four individual lives, by the Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning New York Times journalist.A terminal cancer patient rises from the grave. A medical marvel defies HIV. Two women with autoimmunity discover their own bodies have turned against them. Matt Richtel's An Elegant Defense uniquely entwines these intimate stories with science\u2019s centuries-long quest to unlock the mysteries of sickness and health, and illuminates the immune system as never before.The immune system is our body\u2019s essential defense network, a guardian vigilantly fighting illness, healing wounds, maintaining order and balance, and keeping us alive. Its legion of microscopic foot soldiers\u2014from T cells to \u201cnatural killers\u201d\u2014patrols our body, linked by a nearly instantaneous communications grid. It has been honed by evolution over millennia to face an almost infinite array of threats.For all its astonishing complexity, however, the immune system can be easily compromised by fatigue, stress, toxins, advanced age, and poor nutrition\u2014hallmarks of modern life\u2014and even by excessive hygiene. Paradoxically, it is a fragile wonder weapon that can turn on our own bodies with startling results, leading today to epidemic levels of autoimmune disorders.Richtel effortlessly guides readers on a scientific detective tale winding from the Black Plague to twentieth-century breakthroughs in vaccination and antibiotics, to the cutting-edge laboratories that are revolutionizing immunology\u2014perhaps the most extraordinary and consequential medical story of our time. The foundation that Richtel builds makes accessible revelations about cancer immunotherapy, the microbiome, and autoimmune treatments that are changing millions of lives. An Elegant Defense also captures in vivid detail how these powerful therapies, along with our behavior and environment, interact with the immune system, often for the good but always on a razor\u2019s edge that can throw this remarkable system out of balance.Drawing on his groundbreaking reporting for the New York Times and based on extensive new interviews with dozens of world-renowned scientists, Matt Richtel has produced a landmark book, equally an investigation into the deepest riddles of survival and a profoundly human tale that is movingly brought to life through the eyes of his four main characters, each of whom illuminates an essential facet of our \u201celegant defense.\u201d",

            "description": "The bestselling author of The Willpower Instinct introduces a surprising science-based book that doesn't tell us why we should exercise but instead shows us how to fall in love with movement.Exercise is health-enhancing and life-extending, yet many of us feel it's a chore. But, as Kelly McGonigal reveals, it doesn't have to be. Movement can and should be a source of joy.Through her trademark blend of science and storytelling, McGonigal draws on insights from neuroscience, psychology, anthropology, and evolutionary biology, as well as memoirs, ethnographies, and philosophers. She shows how movement is intertwined with some of the most basic human joys, including self-expression, social connection, and mastery--and why it is a powerful antidote to the modern epidemics of depression, anxiety, and loneliness.McGonigal tells the stories of people who have found fulfillment and belonging through running, walking, dancing, swimming, weightlifting, and more, with examples that span the globe, from Tanzania, where one of the last hunter-gatherer tribes on the planet live, to a dance class at Juilliard for people with Parkinson's disease, to the streets of London, where volunteers combine fitness and community service, to races in the remote wilderness, where athletes push the limits of what a human can endure. Along the way, McGonigal paints a portrait of human nature that highlights our capacity for hope, cooperation, and self-transcendence.The result is a revolutionary narrative that goes beyond familiar arguments in favor of exercise, to illustrate why movement is integral to both our happiness and our humanity. Readers will learn what they can do in their own lives and communities to harness the power of movement to create happiness, meaning, and connection.",

Wallace brings his dazzling literary magic to the game he loved as he celebrates the other-worldly genius of Roger Federer; offers a wickedly witty disection of Tracy Austin's memoir; considers the artistry of Michael Joyce, a supremely disciplined athlete on the threshold of fame; resists the crush of commerce at the U.S. Open; and recalls his own career as a \"near-great\" junior player.Whiting Award-winning writer John Jeremiah Sullivan provides an introduction.",

            "description": "Award-winning journalist Sam Anderson\u2019s long-awaited debut is a brilliant, kaleidoscopic narrative of Oklahoma City--a great American story of civics, basketball, and destiny.Oklahoma City was born from chaos. It was founded in a bizarre but momentous \"Land Run\" in 1889, when thousands of people lined up along the borders of Oklahoma Territory and rushed in at noon to stake their claims. Since then, it has been a city torn between the wild energy that drives its outsized ambitions, and the forces of order that seek sustainable progress. Nowhere was this dynamic better realized than in the drama of the Oklahoma City Thunder basketball team's 2012-13 season, when the Thunder's brilliant general manager, Sam Presti, ignited a firestorm by trading future superstar James Harden just days before the first game. Presti's all-in gamble on \"the Process\"\u2014the patient, methodical management style that dictated the trade as the team\u2019s best hope for long-term greatness\u2014kicked off a pivotal year in the city's history, one that would include pitched battles over urban planning, a series of cataclysmic tornadoes, and the frenzied hope that an NBA championship might finally deliver the glory of which the city had always dreamed.Boom Town announces the arrival of an exciting literary voice. Sam Anderson, former book critic for New York magazine and now a staff writer at the New York Times magazine, unfolds an idiosyncratic mix of American history, sports reporting, urban studies, gonzo memoir, and much more to tell the strange but compelling story of an American city whose unique mix of geography and history make it a fascinating microcosm of the democratic experiment. Filled with characters ranging from NBA superstars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook; to Flaming Lips oddball frontman Wayne Coyne; to legendary Great Plains meteorologist Gary England; to Stanley Draper, Oklahoma City's would-be Robert Moses; to civil rights activist Clara Luper; to the citizens and public servants who survived the notorious 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building, Boom Town offers a remarkable look at the urban tapestry woven from control and chaos, sports and civics.",

            "description": "Billy Beane, general manager of MLB's Oakland A's and protagonist of Michael Lewis's Moneyball, had a problem: how to win in the Major Leagues with a budget that's smaller than that of nearly every other team. Conventional wisdom long held that big name, highly athletic hitters and young pitchers with rocket arms were the ticket to success. But Beane and his staff, buoyed by massive amounts of carefully interpreted statistical data, believed that wins could be had by more affordable methods such as hitters with high on-base percentage and pitchers who get lots of ground outs. Given this information and a tight budget, Beane defied tradition and his own scouting department to build winning teams of young affordable players and inexpensive castoff veterans.Lewis was in the room with the A's top management as they spent the summer of 2002 adding and subtracting players and he provides outstanding play-by-play. In the June player draft, Beane acquired nearly every prospect he coveted (few of whom were coveted by other teams) and at the July trading deadline he engaged in a tense battle of nerves to acquire a lefty reliever. Besides being one of the most insider accounts ever written about baseball, Moneyball is populated with fascinating characters. We meet Jeremy Brown, an overweight college catcher who most teams project to be a 15th round draft pick (Beane takes him in the first). Sidearm pitcher Chad Bradford is plucked from the White Sox triple-A club to be a key set-up man and catcher Scott Hatteberg is rebuilt as a first baseman. But the most interesting character is Beane himself. A speedy athletic can't-miss prospect who somehow missed, Beane reinvents himself as a front-office guru, relying on players completely unlike, say, Billy Beane. Lewis, one of the top nonfiction writers of his era (Liar's Poker, The New New Thing), offers highly accessible explanations of baseball stats and his roadmap of Beane's economic approach makes Moneyball an appealing reading experience for business people and sports fans alike. --John Moe",

            "description": "\"I am just a common man who is true to his beliefs.\"--John WoodenEvoking days gone by when coaches were respected as much for their off-court performances as for their success on the court, Wooden presents the timeless wisdom of legendary basketball coach John Wooden.In honest and telling passages about virtually every aspect of life, Coach shares his personal philosophy on family, achievement, success, and excellence. Raised on a small farm in south-central Indiana, he offers lessons and wisdom learned throughout his career at UCLA, and life as a dedicated husband, father, and teacher.These lessons, along with personal letters from Bill Walton, Denny Crum, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Bob Costas, among others, have made Wooden: A Lifetime of Observations and Reflections on and off the Court an inspirational classic.",

Cooks will find great, kitchen-tested recipes for spicy stews, piquant dips, fragrantly flavored fish dishes, and honey-drenched desserts. They will also be entranced by the hundreds of beautiful photos of Gazan cooks, farmers, and fresh-produce merchants at work, and by the numerous in-kitchen interviews in which these women and men tell the stories of their food, their heritage, and their families. Anthony Bourdain, Claudia Roden, and Yotam Ottolenghi are among the many culinary figures who have embraced The Gaza Kitchen. This second edition features tantalizing new stories and recipes, a fresh new design in a beautiful hardbound volume, new photos, and an updated index.",

With a foreword by New York Times bestselling author Dr. Joseph Mercola.Achieve more with less effort: The secret to weight loss, fitness, and wellness lies in the most basic and most overlooked function of your body\u2014how you breathe. One of the biggest obstacles to better health and fitness is a rarely identified problem: chronic over-breathing. We often take many more breaths than we need\u2014without realizing it\u2014contributing to poor health and fitness, including a host of disorders, from anxiety and asthma to insomnia and heart problems.In The Oxygen Advantage, the man who has trained over 5,000 people\u2014including Olympic and professional athletes\u2014in reduced breathing exercises now shares his scientifically validated techniques to help you breathe more efficiently. Patrick McKeown teaches you the fundamental relationship between oxygen and the body, then gets you started with a Body Oxygen Level Test (BOLT) to determine how efficiently your body uses oxygen. He then shows you how to increase your BOLT score by using light breathing exercises and learning how to simulate high altitude training, a technique used by Navy SEALs and professional athletes to help increase endurance, weight loss, and vital red blood cells to dramatically improve cardio-fitness.",

Allen Carr\u2019s innovative Easyway method\u2014which he discovered after his own 100-cigarette-a-day habit nearly drove him to despair\u2014has helped millions kick smoking without feeling anxious and deprived. That\u2019s because he helps smokers discover the psychological reasons behind their dependency, explains in detail how to handle the withdrawal symptoms, shows them how to avoid situations when temptation might become too strong, and enables them to stay smoke-free. Carr discusses such issues as nicotine addiction; the social \u201cbrainwashing\u201d that encourages smoking; the false belief that a cigarette relieves stress; the role boredom plays in sabotaging efforts to stop; and the main reasons for failure. With this proven program, smokers will be throwing away their packs for good.",

            "description": "An English professor begins training in mixed martial arts in order to learn more about the science and history of men's aggression. Jonathan Gottschall sees a challenge when a mixed martial arts (MMA) facility opens across the street from his business. He works up his courage and finds himself training for an all-out cage battle at the age of forty, out of shape, and dissatisfied with his job as an adjunct English professor. He sees it not only as a personal challenge, but also as a chance to answer topics that have piqued his interest for years: Why do men fight? And why do so many ostensibly good people enjoy watching?Gottschall's unusual journey from the college classroom to the fighting cage drives an important new examination into the science and history of violence in The Professor in the Cage. Our species' insatiable interest in both violence and the rituals that keep violence in check is exemplified by the growing popularity of mixed martial arts (MMA), a full-contact sport in which competitors punch, strangle, and kick each other into submission. Humans are masters of what Gottschall refers to as the monkey dance: a dizzying variety of rule-bound contests that establish hierarchies while minimizing risk and social disorder. From duels to football to child roughhousing, humans are masters of what Gottschall refers to as the monkey dance: a dizzying variety of rule-bound contests that establish hierarchies while minimizing risk and social disorder. Gottschall's harrowing journey\u2014through excruciating agony, humiliation, his wife's skepticism, and, finally, his own cage fight\u2014uncovers the uncomfortable truth that, as horrific as these fights can be, the world would be a much more chaotic and dangerous place without them.",

            "description": "NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY GLAMOUR AND MARIE CLAIREDad: What will set you apart is not talent but will and a certain kind of humility. A willingness to let the world show you things that you play back as you grow as an artist. Talent is cheap. Me: OK I will ponder these things. I am a Carr.Dad: That should matter quite a bit, actually not the name but the guts of what that name means.\u200dA celebrated journalist, bestselling author (The Night of the Gun), and recovering addict, David Carr was in the prime of his career when he suffered a fatal collapse in the newsroom of The New York Times in 2015. Shattered by his death, his daughter Erin Lee Carr, at age twenty-seven an up-and-coming documentary filmmaker, began combing through the entirety of their shared correspondence\u20141,936 items in total\u2014in search of comfort and support.What started as an exercise in grief quickly grew into an active investigation: Did her father\u2019s writings contain the answers to the question of how to move forward in life and work without her biggest champion by her side? How could she fill the space left behind by a man who had come to embody journalistic integrity, rigor, and hard reporting, whose mentorship meant everything not just to her but to the many who served alongside him?\u200dAll That You Leave Behind is a poignant coming-of-age story that offers a raw and honest glimpse into the multilayered relationship between a daughter and a father. Through this lens, Erin comes to understand her own workplace missteps, existential crises, and relationship fails. While daughter and father bond over their mutual addictions and challenges with sobriety, it is their powerful sense of work and family that comes to ultimately define them.This unique combination of Erin Lee Carr\u2019s earnest prose and her father\u2019s meaningful words offers a compelling read that shows us what it means to be vulnerable and lost, supported and found. It is a window into love, with all of its fierceness and frustrations.\u201cThank you, Erin, for this beautiful book. \u00a0Now I am going to steal all of your father\u2019s remarkable advice and tell my kids I thought of it.\u201d\u2014Judd Apatow",

            "description": "Winner of the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for AutobiographyBarbarian Days is William Finnegan\u2019s memoir of an obsession, a complex enchantment. Surfing only looks like a sport. To initiates, it is something else: a beautiful addiction, a demanding course of study, a morally dangerous pastime, a way of life. Raised in California and Hawaii, Finnegan started surfing as a child. He has chased waves all over the world, wandering for years through the South Pacific, Australia, Asia, Africa. A bookish boy, and then an excessively adventurous young man, he went on to become a distinguished writer and war reporter. Barbarian Days takes us deep into unfamiliar worlds, some of them right under our noses\u2014off the coasts of New York and San Francisco. It immerses the reader in the edgy camaraderie of close male friendships forged in challenging waves.Finnegan shares stories of life in a whites-only gang in a tough school in Honolulu. He shows us a world turned upside down for kids and adults alike by the social upheavals of the 1960s. He details the intricacies of famous waves and his own apprenticeships to them. Youthful folly\u2014he drops LSD while riding huge Honolua Bay, on Maui\u2014is served up with rueful humor. As Finnegan\u2019s travels take him ever farther afield, he discovers the picturesque simplicity of a Samoan fishing village, dissects the sexual politics of Tongan interactions with Americans and Japanese, and navigates the Indonesian black market while nearly succumbing to malaria. Throughout, he surfs, carrying readers with him on rides of harrowing, unprecedented lucidity.Barbarian Days is an old-school adventure story, an intellectual autobiography, a social history, a literary road movie, and an extraordinary exploration of the gradual mastering of an exacting, little-understood art.",

            "description": "For readers of Laura Hillenbrand's Seabiscuit and Unbroken, the dramatic story of the American rowing team that stunned the world at Hitler's 1936 Berlin Olympics.Daniel James Brown's robust book tells the story of the University of Washington's 1936 eight-oar crew and their epic quest for an Olympic gold medal, a team that transformed the sport and grabbed the attention of millions of Americans. The sons of loggers, shipyard workers, and farmers, the boys defeated elite rivals first from eastern and British universities and finally the German crew rowing for Adolf Hitler in the Olympic games in Berlin, 1936.The emotional heart of the story lies with one rower, Joe Rantz, a teenager without family or prospects, who rows not for glory, but to regain his shattered self-regard and to find a place he can call home. The crew is assembled by an enigmatic coach and mentored by a visionary, eccentric British boat builder, but it is their trust in each other that makes them a victorious team. They remind the country of what can be done when everyone quite literally pulls together\u2014a perfect melding of commitment, determination, and optimism.Drawing on the boys' own diaries and journals, their photos and memories of a once-in-a-lifetime shared dream, The Boys in the Boat is an irresistible story about beating the odds and finding hope in the most desperate of times\u2014the improbable, intimate story of nine working-class boys from the American west who, in the depths of the Great Depression, showed the world what true grit really meant. It will appeal to readers of Erik Larson, Timothy Egan, James Bradley, and David Halberstam's The Amateurs.",

            "description": "Two New York Times\u2013bestselling authors unveil new research showing what meditation can really do for the brain. In the last twenty years, meditation and mindfulness have gone from being kind of cool to becoming an omnipresent Band-Aid for fixing everything from your weight to your relationship to your achievement level. Unveiling here the kind of cutting-edge research that has made them giants in their fields, Daniel Goleman and Richard Davidson show us the truth about what meditation can really do for us, as well as exactly how to get the most out of it.Sweeping away common misconceptions and neuromythology to open readers\u2019 eyes to the ways data has been distorted to sell mind-training methods, the authors demonstrate that beyond the pleasant states mental exercises can produce, the real payoffs are the lasting personality traits that can result. But short daily doses will not get us to the highest level of lasting positive change\u2014even if we continue for years\u2014without specific additions. More than sheer hours, we need smart practice, including crucial ingredients such as targeted feedback from a master teacher and a more spacious, less attached view of the self, all of which are missing in widespread versions of mind training. The authors also reveal the latest data from Davidson\u2019s own lab that point to a new methodology for developing a broader array of mind-training methods with larger implications for how we can derive the greatest benefits from the practice.Exciting, compelling, and grounded in new research, this is one of those rare books that has the power to change us at the deepest level.",

            "description": "Shortlisted for the FT/McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award, The 100-Year Life explores how living to 100 will have a profound effect on society and the economy, and result in a complete restructuring of everyone's professional and personal lives.Drawing on the unique pairing of their experience in psychology and economics, Lynda Gratton and Andrew Scott offer an analysis to help you rethink retirement, your finances, your education, your career, and your relationships to create a fulfilling 100-year life.Many of us have been raised on the traditional notion of a three-stage approach to our working lives: education, followed by work and then retirement. But this well-established pathway is already beginning to collapse--life expectancy is rising, final-salary pensions are vanishing, and increasing numbers of people are juggling multiple careers. Whether you are 18, 45, or 60, you will need to do things very differently from previous generations and learn to structure your life in completely new ways.The 100-Year Life is a wake-up call that describes the choices and options that you will face in the age of longevity. It is also fundamentally a call to action for individuals, politicians, firms, and governments and offers the clearest demonstration that a 100-year life can be a wonderful and inspiring one.",

            "description": "Trauma is a fact of life. Veterans and their families deal with the painful aftermath of combat; one in five Americans has been molested; one in four grew up with alcoholics; one in three couples have engaged in physical violence. Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, one of the world\u2019s foremost experts on trauma, has spent over three decades working with survivors. In The Body Keeps the Score, he uses recent scientific advances to show how trauma literally reshapes both body and brain, compromising sufferers\u2019 capacities for pleasure, engagement, self-control, and trust. He explores innovative treatments\u2014from neurofeedback and meditation to sports, drama, and yoga\u2014that offer new paths to recovery by activating the brain\u2019s natural neuroplasticity. Based on Dr. van der Kolk\u2019s own research and that of other leading specialists, The Body Keeps the Score exposes the tremendous power of our relationships both to hurt and to heal\u2014and offers new hope for reclaiming lives.",

            "description": "Most of us have heard of gluten\u2014a protein found in wheat that causes widespread inflammation in the body. Americans spend billions of dollars on gluten-free diets in an effort to protect their health. But what if we\u2019ve been missing the root of the problem? In The Plant Paradox, renowned cardiologist Dr. Steven Gundry reveals that gluten is just one variety of a common, and highly toxic, plant-based protein called lectin. Lectins are found not only in grains like wheat but also in the \u201cgluten-free\u201d foods most of us commonly regard as healthy, including many fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans, and conventional dairy products. Plants' seeds, grains, skins, rinds, and leaves contain these proteins, which are meant by nature to defend them from predators (including humans). They initiate a type of chemical warfare in our bodies once they've been consumed, generating inflammatory reactions that can lead to weight gain and major health problems.Dr. Gundry has successfully treated tens of thousands of patients with autoimmune illnesses, diabetes, leaky gut syndrome, heart disease, and neurodegenerative diseases using a regimen that detoxes the cells, heals the gut, and nourishes the body at his waitlist-only clinics in California. He now offers this scientifically proven method with people all around the world in The Plant Paradox.The Plant Paradox uncovers the hidden risks lying in your salad bowl\u2014and teaches you how to consume whole foods in a whole new way\u2014with a detailed list of lectin-containing items and simple substitutions for each, a step-by-step detox and diet plan, and delicious lectin-free recipes.",

            "description": "The definitive story of American health care today\u2014its causes, consequences, and confusions.In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. It was the most extensive reform of America's health care system since at least the creation of Medicare in 1965, and maybe ever. The ACA was controversial and highly political, and the law faced legal challenges reaching all the way to the Supreme Court; it even precipitated a government shutdown. It was a signature piece of legislation for President Obama's first term, and also a ball and chain for his second.Ezekiel J. Emanuel, a professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania who also served as a special adviser to the White House on health care reform, has written a brilliant diagnostic explanation of why health care in America has become such a divisive social issue, how money and medicine have their own\u2014quite distinct\u2014American story, and why reform has bedeviled presidents of the left and right for more than one hundred years.Emanuel also explains exactly how the ACA reforms are reshaping the health care system now. He forecasts the future, identifying six mega trends in health that will determine the market for health care to 2020 and beyond. His predictions are bold, provocative, and uniquely well-informed. Health care\u2014one of America's largest employment sectors, with an economy the size of the GDP of France\u2014has never had a more comprehensive or authoritative interpreter.",

            "description": "Co-founder and editor in chief of The Huffington Post Arianna Huffington shows how our cultural dismissal of sleep as time wasted compromises our health and our decision-making and undermines our work lives, our personal lives--and even our sex lives in this New York Times bestseller.We are in the midst of a sleep deprivation crisis, with profound consequences to our health, our job performance, our relationships and our happiness. What we need is nothing short of a sleep revolution: only by renewing our relationship with sleep can we take back control of our lives.In The Sleep Revolution, Arianna explores all the latest science on what exactly is going on while we sleep and dream. She takes on the sleeping pill industry, and all the ways our addiction to technology disrupts our sleep. She also offers a range of recommendations and tips from leading scientists on how we can get better and more restorative sleep, and harness its incredible power.The result is a sweeping, scientifically rigorous, and deeply personal exploration of sleep from all angles, from the history of sleep, to the role of dreams in our lives, to the consequences of sleep deprivation, and the new golden age of sleep science that reveals the vital role sleep plays in our every waking moment and every aspect of our health--from weight gain, diabetes, and heart disease to cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s. \u00a0In today's fast-paced, always-connected, perpetually-harried and sleep-deprived world, our need for a good night\u2019s sleep is more important--and elusive--than ever. The Sleep Revolution both sounds the alarm on our worldwide sleep crisis and provides a detailed road map to the great sleep awakening that can help transform our lives, our communities, and our world.",

            "description": "The bestselling author of The Brain That Changes Itself presents astounding advances in the treatment of brain injury and illness.In The Brain That Changes Itself, Norman Doidge described the most important breakthrough in our understanding of the brain in four hundred years: the discovery that the brain can change its own structure and function in response to mental experience\u2014what we call neuroplasticity.His revolutionary new book shows, for the first time, how the amazing process of neuroplastic healing really works. It describes natural, non-invasive avenues into the brain provided by the forms of energy around us\u2014light, sound, vibration, movement\u2014which pass through our senses and our bodies to awaken the brain\u2019s own healing capacities without producing unpleasant side effects. Doidge explores cases where patients alleviated years of chronic pain or recovered from debilitating strokes or accidents; children on the autistic spectrum or with learning disorders normalizing; symptoms of multiple sclerosis, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and cerebral palsy radically improved, and other near-miracle recoveries. And we learn how to vastly reduce the risk of dementia with simple approaches anyone can use.For centuries it was believed that the brain\u2019s complexity prevented recovery from damage or disease. The Brain\u2019s Way of Healing shows that this very sophistication is the source of a unique kind of healing. As he did so lucidly in The Brain That Changes Itself, Doidge uses stories to present cutting-edge science with practical real-world applications, and principles that everyone can apply to improve their brain\u2019s performance and health.",

Abby shows us by example how to overcome problems and live a happier, braver life.\" \u2014Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook COO, New York Times Bestselling author of Lean In\u200d\u201cThis is the best memoir I\u2019ve read by an athlete since Andre Agassi\u2019s Open. I could not put it down, and you will not want it to end.\u201d \u00a0\u2014Adam Grant, Wharton professor and New York Times bestselling author of Originals and Give and Take\u200dAbby Wambach has always pushed the limits of what is possible. At age seven she was put on the boys\u2019 soccer team. At age thirty-five she would become the highest goal scorer\u2014male or female\u2014in the history of soccer, capturing the nation\u2019s heart with her team\u2019s 2015 World Cup Championship. Called an inspiration and \u201cbadass\u201d by President Obama, Abby has become a fierce advocate for women\u2019s rights and equal opportunity, pushing to translate the success of her team to the real world.As she reveals in this searching memoir, Abby\u2019s professional success often masked her inner struggle to reconcile the various parts of herself: ferocious competitor, daughter, leader, wife. With stunning candor, Abby shares her inspiring and often brutal journey from girl in Rochester, New York, to world-class athlete. Far more than a sports memoir, Forward is gripping tale of resilience and redemption\u2014and a reminder that heroism is, above all, about embracing life\u2019s challenges with fearlessness and heart.",

            "description": "Ball Four is a baseball classic, a number one bestseller when it was published; it still is in demand throughout the U.S. Now in a new updated hardcover edition, Ball Four will reach a whole new generation of avid baseball fans. In fact, Ball Four has been selected by the NY Public Library as one of the Books of the Century. And David Halberstam writes: a book deep in the American Vein, so deep in fact that is by no means a sports book. Bouton has written a baseball book about the reality of the game. Thirty years after its publication, it remains as wonderful to read as ever.",

Because when your protein sources come from animals, you\u2019re missing out on all of the nutritional benefits of a plant-based diet\u2014a diet that can make you more fit, more sexy, and more manly. ??In Meat is for Pussies, Joseph presents a throw-down of information, offering both personal and scientific evidence that a plant-based diet offers the best path to athleticism, endurance, strength, and overall health. In addition to handily dispelling the myths surrounding meat, Joseph offers workout advice, a meal plan, and recipes that make going plant-based easy. Flavor and vitamin-packed options like the Working Man Stew and Veggie Chili with Cornbread will keep men\u2019s (and women\u2019s) bodies healthy and energized, while workouts that emphasize cardio and strength training build endurance and stamina and prove that you don\u2019t need meat to build muscle.??Joseph also offers living proof that living a plant-based lifestyle is badass, from super-athlete Brendan Brazier to MMA champion Jake Shields to Joseph himself, who is an Ironman Triathlete and still rocking out (at the age of fifty-two) on world tours as the frontman for his legendary band the Cro-Mags. Joseph\u2019s passion for educating the world about the benefits of a plant-based diet comes through on each page, in a voice and a vocabulary that is uniquely his own. At the end of the day, he wants readers to live a long, healthy, happy life . . . and he won\u2019t take no for an answer.",

Now Lady Green returns with the publication of the revised and updated third edition of her classic The Sexually Dominant Woman. This friendly, non-threatening book is the perfect starting point for the woman who has fantasized about erotic power play, explaining the fundamentals of bondage, sensation and control games. It includes a script to inspire and support the novice through her first scene, a new section on partner-finding skills and updated information on the possible emotional effects of female-dominant play.",

            "description": "In December 2010, Professor Tim Noakes was introduced to a way of eating that was contrary to everything he had been taught and was accepted as conventional nutrition \u2018wisdom\u2019. Having observed the benefits of the low-carb, high-fat lifestyle first-hand, and after thorough and intensive research, Noakes enthusiastically revealed his findings to the South African public in 2012. The backlash from his colleagues in the medical establishment was as swift as it was brutal, and culminated in a misconduct inquiry launched by the Health Professions Council of South Africa. The subsequent hearing lasted well over a year, but Noakes ultimately triumphed, being found not guilty of unprofessional conduct in April 2017. In Lore of Nutrition, he explains the science behind the low-carb, high-fat/Banting diet, and why he champions this lifestyle despite the constant persecution and efforts to silence him.He also discusses at length what he has come to see as a medical and scientific code of silence that discourages anyone in the profession from speaking out against the current dietary guidelines. Leading food, health and medical journalist Marika Sboros, who attended every day of the HPCSA hearing, provides the fascinating backstory to the inquiry, which often reads like a spy novel. Lore of Nutrition is an eye-opener and a must-read for anyone who cares about their health.",

I go the other way and use spices, herbs and other ingredients to create a sense of surprise.\" Not a vegetarian himself, his approach to vegetable dishes is wholly original and innovative, based on freshness and seasonality, and drawn from the diverse food cultures represented in London.The Plenty cookbook: Plenty is the cookbook that launched Yotam Ottolenghi from a fabulous chef, London restaurant owner, and British newspaper columnist to an international food celebrity. In Plenty , Yotam puts a spotlight on vegetarian restaurant-caliber recipes that every home cook can make. A vibrant photo accompanies every recipe in this visually stunning Ottolenghi cookbook. Essential for meat-eaters and vegetarians alike!Plenty is an indispensable cookbook for every home library.",

But in his early twenties, a picture of Hanoi sparked a curiosity that propelled him halfway across the globe. Graham didn\u2019t want to be a tourist in an alien land, though; he was determined to live it. An ordinary guy who liked trying interesting food, he moved to the capital city and embarked on a quest to find real Vietnamese food. In Eating Viet Nam, he chronicles his odyssey in this strange, enticing land infused with sublime smells and tastes.Traveling through the back alleys and across the boulevards of Hanoi\u2014where home cooks set up grills and stripped-down stands serving sumptuous fare on blue plastic furniture\u2014he risked dysentery, giardia, and diarrhea to discover a culinary treasure-load that was truly foreign and unique. Holliday shares every bite of the extraordinary fresh dishes, pungent and bursting with flavor, which he came to love in Hanoi, Saigon, and the countryside. Here, too, are the remarkable people who became a part of his new life, including his wife, Sophie.A feast for the senses, funny, charming, and always delicious, Eating Viet Nam will inspire armchair travelers, curious palates, and everyone itching for a taste of adventure.",

            "description": "Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning writer George Dohrmann takes readers inside the system that develops America's basketball stars, thanks to eight years of unrestrained access, a sharp awareness of a story's fundamental realities, and true love for his subject.\u200dBasketball aspirations aren't limited to athletes. Coaches, parents, and shoe executives are all affected by the fever that consumes collegiate basketball hopefuls expecting to hit big-time NBA gold. Every one of them has a vested interest in keeping America's outrageously dysfunctional, enormously profitable youth basketball machine afloat, no matter the cost.George Dohrmann gives us an up-close and memorable glimpse inside the jaws of the machine in Play Their Hearts Out. He explains what he learnt while travelling the country with a group of exceptional young recruits from Southern California competing in premier Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) tournaments. Boys as young as eight or nine years old are vulnerable to a barrage of scrutiny and exploitation in this ruthless society. Coaches compete for their services. They are plied with free shoes and kit by sneaker makers. \"All-star camps\" are essentially glorified cattle auctions, with make-or-break possibilities to get a coveted college scholarship.The personal stories of two compelling figures are at the heart of the book: Joe Keller, an ambitious AAU coach with a master plan to find and promote \"the next LeBron\"\u2014thereby paving his own path to power and wealth; and Demetrius Walker, a fatherless latchkey kid who falls under Keller's sway and struggles to live up to the unrealistic expectations his ostensible benefactor has set for him. As their fortunes unfold and the strain mounts\u2014Demetrius is covered in Sports Illustrated at the age of fourteen, while Keller builds his business empire\u2014Dohrmann interweaves the lives of a slew of other parents, coaches, and athletes. As a result of poor judgments and bad luck, some of them see their chances dwindle. Others learn to prosper in a corrupt system by finding the appropriate angles to play.Play Their Hearts Out is a truly unique novel that explores the inner workings of an American game, exposing the brutal truth that lurks underneath so many aspirations of fame and glory, written with extraordinary detail and insight.",

            "description": "A groundbreaking and fascinating investigation into the transformative effects of exercise on the brain, from the bestselling author and renowned psychiatrist John J. Ratey, MD.Did you know you can beat stress, lift your mood, fight memory loss, sharpen your intellect, and function better than ever simply by elevating your heart rate and breaking a sweat? The evidence is incontrovertible: Aerobic exercise physically remodels our brains for peak performance.In Spark, John J. Ratey, M.D., embarks upon a fascinating and entertaining journey through the mind-body connection, presenting startling research to prove that exercise is truly our best defense against everything from depression to ADD to addiction to aggression to menopause to Alzheimer's.Filled with amazing case studies (such as the revolutionary fitness program in Naperville, Illinois, which has put this school district of 19,000 kids first in the world of science test scores), Spark is the first book to explore comprehensively the connection between exercise and the brain. It will change forever the way you think about your morning run -- -or, for that matter, simply the way you think.",

On several occasions in the past I have trained intensively for a period, to prove one of my theories. My special twenty weeks' training which took place in my thirty-fifth year, culminating in the winning of the professional heavyweight lifting championship of America, with an improvement in strength and physique which represented a world's record for physical gains, was convincing proof to many.Throughout my entire amateur and professional career I have always practised what I preached and have obtained splendid results with the methods I offer to others. Most men who are interested in physical betterment only wish to feel well and to look well. Many thousands of this class have obtained their physical desires with the training system I offer. They and the men who desired and have obtained a symmetrical physique or great strength, have told others. They in turn have told still others until I have become, by a very great margin, the world's leading physical director.\" -Bob Hoffman",

            "description": "Robert Adair investigates what a baseball or player in motion does\u2014and why\u2014using a mix of scientific truth and sports knowledge. How quickly can a hit ball travel? How do stitch patterns influence wind resistance? What is the maximum distance a curve ball can travel? A right-handed batter or a left-handed batter gets first base faster after a bunt? The results are frequently startling \u2014 and always instructive.This freshly revised third edition takes into account current advances in sports science, such as batting neurophysiology, bat vibration, and the nature of the \"sweet spot.\" Faster pitchers, longer batters, and enclosed stadiums are all given a thorough scientific examination to see how they affect the game. The Physics of Baseball is a fascinating look at America's favorite game, filled with tales about notable players and occurrences.",

A deep passion in creation runs through all of his work. Questlove takes his insatiable interest to the realm of food in Something to Food About. He investigates what makes 10 inventive chefs in America tick, how they perceive the world via their cuisine, and how their cooking teaches them to see the world through talks with ten innovative chefs in America. Food starts the conversation, but it ends wherever food takes them. Food is a source of energy. Food is a form of culture. Food is a part of history. And food is thinking food.\u200d",

            "description": "Worldwide, depression will be the single biggest cause of disability in the next twenty years. But treatment for it has not changed much in the last three decades. In the world of psychiatry, time has apparently stood still...until now with Edward Bullmore's The Inflamed Mind: A Radical New Approach to Depression.In this game-changing book, University of Cambridge profressor of psychiatry Edward Bullmore reveals the breakthrough new science on the link between depression and inflammation of the body and brain. He explains how and why we now know that mental disorders can have their root cause in the immune system, and outlines a future revolution in which treatments could be specifically targeted to break the vicious cycles of stress, inflammation, and depression.The Inflamed Mind goes far beyond the clinic and the lab, representing a whole new way of looking at how mind, brain, and body all work together in a sometimes misguided effort to help us survive in a hostile world. It offers insights into how we could start getting to grips with depression and other mental disorders much more effectively in the future.",

            "description": "Along with the many benefits of leisure-class living comes obesity and its attendant ailments. In The Warrior Diet, Ori Hofmekler looks not forward but backward for a solution\u2013to the primal habits of early cultures such as nomads and hunter-gatherers, the Greeks, and the Romans. Based on survival science, this book proposes not ordinary dietary changes but rather a radical yet surprisingly simple lifestyle overhaul.Drawing on both scientific studies and historical data, Hofmekler argues that robust health and a lean, strong body can best be achieved by mimicking the classical warrior mode of cycling\u2014working and eating sparingly (undereating) during the day and filling up at night. Specific elements from the Warrior Diet Nutritional Program (finding ideal fuel foods and food combinations to reduce body fat) to the Controlled Fatigue Training Program (promoting strength, speed, and resilience to fatigue through special drills), literally reshape body and mind. Individual chapters cover warrior meals and recipes; sex drive, potency, and animal magnetism; as well as personalizing the diet for women. Featuring forewords by Fit for Life author Harvey Diamond and Fat That Kills author Dr. Udo Erasmus, The Warrior Diet shows readers weary of fad diets how to attain enduring vigor, explosive strength, a better appearance, and increased vitality and health.",

            "description": "On September 2, 2013, at the age of sixty-four, Diana Nyad emerged onto the sands of Key West after swimming 111 miles, nation to nation, Cuba to Florida, in an epic feat of both endurance and human will, in fifty-three hours. Diana carried three poignant messages on her way across this stretch of shark-infested waters, and she spoke them to the crowd in her moment of final triumph:Never, ever give up.You\u2019re never too old to chase your dreams.It looks like a solitary sport, but \u00a0it\u2019s a Team.Millions of people around the world cheered this maverick on, moved by her undeniable tenacity to be the first to make the historic crossing without the aid of a shark cage. At the end of her magnificent journey, after thirty-five years and four crushing failures, the public found hope in Diana\u2019s perseverance. They were inspired by her mantra\u2014find a way\u2014that led her to realize a dream in her sixties that had eluded her as a young champion in peak form.In Find a Way, Diana engages us with a unique, passionate story of this heroic adventure and the extraordinary life experiences that have served to carve her unwavering spirit.Diana was a world champion in her twenties, setting the record for swimming around Manhattan Island, along with other ocean-swim achievements, all of which rendered her a star at the time. Back then, she made the first attempt at the Mount Everest of swims, the Cuba Swim, but after forty-two hours and seventy-nine miles she was blown desperately off course. Her dream unfulfilled, she didn\u2019t swim another stroke for three decades.Why, at sixty-four, was she able to achieve what she could not at thirty? How did her dramatic failures push her to success? What inner resources did Diana draw on during her long days and nights of training, and how did the power of the human spirit trump both the limitations of the body and the forces of nature across this vast, dangerous wilderness? This is the gripping story of an athlete, of a hero, of a bold mind. This is a galvanizing meditation on facing fears, engaging in our lives full throttle, and living each day with no regrets.",

Dominique Ansel expresses his gratitude for the amazing fortune that led him to create the first Cronut. Woody Allen's mother would only allow Lenny Berk to slice her lox at Zabar's, as related by Lenny Berk. Ghaya Oliveira, a young Tunisian stockbroker who arrived to New York as a dishwasher, talks about her difficult but quick rise from dishwashing to executive pastry chef at Daniel. Eddie Schoenfeld, the indisputably Chinese food maven of New York, recounts his journey from Nice Jewish Boy from Brooklyn to New York's Indisputable Chinese Food Maven.Food and the City is a fascinating oral history with an unforgettable gallery of New Yorkers who embody the heart and soul of a culinary metropolis, from old-schoolers like David Fox, third-generation owner of Fox's U-bet syrup, and the outspoken Upper West Side butcher \"Schatzie\" to new-kids-on-the-block like Patrick Collins, sous chef at The Dutch, and Brooklyn artisan Lauren Clark of Sucre Mort Pralines.",

            "description": "How shall we improve human health? One answer is: by eradication. The Gates Foundation announced in 2007 that their goal is malaria eradication; another of their priorities is polio eradication. Eradication means the complete elimination of a disease through deliberate human intervention. It stands for an absolute in public health.This book by the award-winning historian of medicine Nancy Leys Stepan is an accessible, beautifully written, and deeply researched examination of one of the most controversial issues in public health today. The eradication of disease might seem like an absolute good. But critics of eradication argue that the huge resources needed to achieve eradication could be better allocated toward developing primary health services and general improvement in health.This book aims to look at the benefits and drawbacks of single-minded efforts to rid the world of particular diseases, one at a time. The sweep of the book is impressive, from the origins of the idea of complete eradication in the early twentieth century until the present-day campaigns against polio, Guinea worm disease, and now malaria. The author places eradication's story in its many contexts, from imperialism, changing notions of public health, the history of medicine and its technologies, the development of international health agencies such as the World Health Organization, and the impact of the Cold War on the shift of attention to disease in developing countries.At the center of this narrative is Dr. Fred Lowe Soper (1893\u20131977), a U.S.-trained doctor who became the arch-eradicationist of his time. His campaigns to eradicate hookworm disease, yaws, yellow fever, malaria, and smallpox are treated in compelling detail, as are the roles of international health agencies such as the Rockefeller Foundation and the World Health Organization.Throughout the book Stepan draws attention to the way that the ideal of eradication has repeatedly arisen, phoenix-like, from its setbacks. In a powerful conclusion, she uses the example of the current campaign to eradicate Guinea worm disease to argue that, today, under the right circumstances, eradication and primary health care need not be in conflict, as they were in the past, but can form mutually reinforcing policies to improve the health and well-being of populations, especially the poorest and most disease-burdened populations of the world.",

            "description": "Meat eating is often a contentious subject, whether considering the technical, ethical, environmental, political, or health-related aspects of production and consumption.This book is a wide-ranging and interdisciplinary examination and critique of meat consumption by humans, throughout their evolution and around the world. Setting the scene with a chapter on meat\u2019s role in human evolution and its growing influence during the development of agricultural practices, the book goes on to examine modern production systems, their efficiencies, outputs, and impacts. The major global trends of meat consumption are described in order to find out what part its consumption plays in changing modern diets in countries around the world. The heart of the book addresses the consequences of the \"massive carnivory\" of western diets, looking at the inefficiencies of production and at the huge impacts on land, water, and the atmosphere. Health impacts are also covered, both positive and negative. In conclusion, the author looks forward at his vision of \u201crational meat eating\u201d, where environmental and health impacts are reduced, animals are treated more humanely, and alternative sources of protein make a higher contribution.Should We Eat Meat? is not an ideological tract for or against carnivorousness but rather a careful evaluation of meat's roles in human diets and the environmental and health consequences of its production and consumption. It will be of interest to a wide readership including professionals and academics in food and agricultural production, human health and nutrition, environmental science, and regulatory and policy making bodies around the world.",

            "description": "HEIDI SWANSON'S approach to cooking whole, natural foods has earned her a global readership. From her Northern California kitchen, she introduced us to a less-processed world of cooking and eating through her award-winning blog, 101 Cookbooks, and in her James Beard Award\u2013nominated cookbook, Super Natural Cooking, she taught us how to expand our pantries and integrate nutrient-rich superfoods into our diets.In Super Natural Every Day, Heidi helps us make nutritionally packed meals part of our daily repertoire by sharing a sumptuous collection of nearly 100 of her go-to recipes. These are the dishes that Heidi returns to again and again because they\u2019re approachable, good for the body, and just plain delicious. This stylish cookbook is equal parts inspiration and instruction, showing us how to create a welcoming table filled with nourishing food for friends and family.The seductively flavorful vegetarian recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, treats, and drinks are quick to the table but tasty enough to linger over. Grab a Millet Muffin or some flaky Yogurt Biscuits for breakfast on the go, or settle into a lazy Sunday morning with a stack of Multi-grain Pancakes and a steaming cup of Ginger Tea. A bowl of Summer Squash Soup or a couple of Chanterelle Tacos make for a light and healthy lunch, and for dinner, there\u2019s Black Sesame Otsu, Pomegranate-Glazed Eggplant with Tempeh, or the aptly named Weeknight Curry. Heidi\u2019s Rose Geranium Prosecco is the perfect start to a celebratory meal, and the Buttermilk Cake with fresh plums or Sweet Panzanella will satisfy even the most stubborn sweet tooth.Gorgeously illustrated with over 100 photos that showcase the engaging rhythms of Heidi\u2019s culinary life and travels, Super Natural Every Day reveals the beauty of uncomplicated food prepared well and reflects a realistic yet gourmet approach to a healthy and sophisticated natural foods lifestyle.",

            "description": "When Diana Henry was sixteen she started a menu notebook (an exercise book carefully covered in wrapping paper). Planning a menu is still her favourite part of cooking.Menus can create very different moods; they can take you places, from an afternoon at the seaside in Brittany to a sultry evening eating mezze in Istanbul. They also have to work as a meal that flows and as a group of dishes that the cook can manage without becoming totally stressed. The 24 menus and 100 recipes in this book reflect places Diana loves, and dishes that are real favorites.The menus are introduced with personal essays in Diana's now well-known voice- about places or journeys or particular times and explain the choice of dishes. Each menu is a story in itself, but the recipes can also stand alone.The title of the book refers to how Italians end a meal in the summer, when it's too hot to cook. The host or hostess just puts a bowl of peaches on the table and offers glasses of chilled moscato (or even Marsala). Guests then slice their peach into the glass, before eating the slices and drinking the wine.That says something very important about eating - simplicity and generosity and sometimes not cooking are what it's about.",

            "description": "Moneyball meets medicine in this remarkable chronicle of one of the greatest scientific quests of our time\u2014the groundbreaking program to answer the most essential question for humanity: how do we live and die?\u2014and the visionary mastermind behind it.Medical doctor and economist Christopher Murray began the Global Burden of Disease studies to gain a truer understanding of how we live and how we die. While it is one of the largest scientific projects ever attempted\u2014as breathtaking as the first moon landing or the Human Genome Project\u2014the questions it answers are meaningful for every one of us: What are the world\u2019s health problems? Who do they hurt? How much? Where? Why?Murray argues that the ideal existence isn\u2019t simply the longest but the one lived well and with the least illness. Until we can accurately measure how people live and die, we cannot understand what makes us sick or do much to improve it. Challenging the accepted wisdom of the WHO and the UN, the charismatic and controversial health maverick has made enemies\u2014and some influential friends, including Bill Gates who gave Murray a $100 million grant.In Epic Measures, journalist Jeremy N. Smith offers an intimate look at Murray and his groundbreaking work. From ranking countries\u2019 healthcare systems (the U.S. is 37th) to unearthing the shocking reality that world governments are funding developing countries at only 30% of the potential maximum efficiency when it comes to health, Epic Measures introduces a visionary leader whose unwavering determination to improve global health standards has already changed the way the world addresses issues of health and wellness, sets policy, and distributes funding.",

In all of them, actually \u2013 from Dumbo to Peter Pan to The Lion King -- and had to learn about life and love mostly from what could be gleaned from animated characters, dancing across a screen of color? Asking this question opens a doorway to the most extraordinary of stories. It is the saga of Owen Suskind, who happens to be the son of one of America's most noted writers, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author Ron Suskind. He's also autistic. The twisting, 20-year journey of this boy and his family will change that way you see autism, old Disney movies, and the power of imagination to heal a shattered, upside-down world.",

            "description": "\"Tomorrow's Table\" argues that a judicious blend of two important strands of agriculture--genetic engineering and organic farming--is key to helping feed the world's growing population in an ecologically balanced manner. Pamela Ronald, a geneticist, and her husband, Raoul Adamchak, an organic farmer, take the reader inside their lives for roughly a year, allowing us to look over their shoulders so that we can see what geneticists and organic farmers actually do. Readers see the problems that farmers face, trying to provide larger yields without resorting to expensive or environmentally hazardous chemicals--a problem that will loom larger and larger as the century progresses--and they learn how organic farmers and geneticists address these problems. The book is for consumers, farmers, and policy decision makers who want to make food choices and policy that will support ecologically responsible farming practices, and for anyone who wants accurate information about organic farming, genetic engineering, and their potential impacts on human health and the environment.The first edition was published in hardcover in 2008 and in paperback in 2009. This second edition reflects the many and varied changes the fields of farming and genetic engineering have seen since 2009. It includes a new preface and three new chapters-one on politics and food-related protests such as the Marin county anti-vaccine movement and the subsequent outbreak of whooping cough, one on farming and food security, and one containing various recipes. Existing chapters on the tools of genetic engineering, organic vs. conventional foods, the tools of organic agriculture, and food labeling and legislature have all been updated.",

            "description": "Most of us know what it feels like to fall under the spell of food\u2014when one slice of pizza turns into half a pie, or a handful of chips leads to an empty bag. But it\u2019s harder to understand why we can't seem to stop eating\u2014even when we know better. When we want so badly to say \"no,\" why do we continue to reach for food?Dr. David Kessler, the dynamic former FDA commissioner who reinvented the food label and tackled the tobacco industry, now reveals how the food industry has hijacked the brains of millions of Americans. The result? America\u2019s number-one public health issue. Dr. Kessler cracks the code of overeating by explaining how our bodies and minds are changed when we consume foods that contain sugar, fat, and salt. Food manufacturers create products by manipulating these ingredients to stimulate our appetites, setting in motion a cycle of desire and consumption that ends with a nation of overeaters. The End of Overeating explains for the first time why it is exceptionally difficult to resist certain foods and why it\u2019s so easy to overindulge.Dr. Kessler met with top scientists, physicians, and food industry insiders. The End of Overeating uncovers the shocking facts about how we lost control over our eating habits\u2014and how we can get it back. Dr. Kessler presents groundbreaking research, along with what is sure to be a controversial view inside the industry that continues to feed a nation of overeaters\u2014from popular brand manufacturers to advertisers, chain restaurants, and fast food franchises.For the millions of people struggling with weight as well as for those of us who simply don't understand why we can't seem to stop eating our favorite foods, Dr. Kessler\u2019s cutting-edge investigation offers new insights and helpful tools to help us find a solution.There has never been a more thorough, compelling, or in-depth analysis of why we eat the way we do.",

He was Big East Co-Player of the Year at UConn, the 10th overall pick of the 2002 NBA Draft and a key player for the Dallas Mavericks in their championship-winning season in 2011. But before Butler had a chance to prove himself on the court, he spent his time trying to prove himself on the streets, as a gang member and drug dealer in his hometown of Racine, Wisconsin. He sawfriends gunned down in the bloody street wars near his home, was arrested nearly 15 times and wound up behind bars and in solitary confinement before his 15th birthday. Tuff Juiceshares Caron Butler s extraordinary journey from hisdelinquentyouth in the streets of Racine to his role as an accomplished pro basketball player, dedicated husband and father, active philanthropist and burgeoning businessman.Along the way, the book explores the incredible impact his single mother s unconditional love and his college coach s unwavering support had on him, and what drives him to be so successful in basketball and in life. LikeThe Blind Side, it s a gripping narrative filled with hubris, dangerous obstacles and heartwarming moments that transcend sports and speak to perseverance, hope and the triumph of the human spirit.\"",

            "description": "From the best-selling author of Why We Get Fat, a groundbreaking, eye-opening expose that makes the convincing case that sugar is the tobacco of the new millennium: backed by powerful lobbies, entrenched in our lives, and making us very sick.Among Americans, diabetes is more prevalent today than ever; obesity is at epidemic proportions; nearly 10% of children are thought to have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. And sugar is at the root of these, and other, critical society-wide, health-related problems. With his signature command of both science and straight talk, Gary Taubes delves into Americans' history with sugar: its uses as a preservative, as an additive in cigarettes, the contemporary overuse of high-fructose corn syrup. He explains what research has shown about our addiction to sweets. He clarifies the arguments against sugar, corrects misconceptions about the relationship between sugar and weight loss; and provides the perspective necessary to make informed decisions about sugar as individuals and as a society.",

An important and persuasive appeal to conscience, fairness, decency and justice, Animal Liberation is essential reading for the supporter and the skeptic alike.",

            "description": "Brian Kateman coined the term \"Reducetarian\"--a person who is deliberately reducing his or her consumption of meat--and a global movement was born. In this book, Kateman, the founder of the Reducetarian Foundation, presents more than 70 original essays from influential thinkers on how the simple act of cutting 10% or more of the meat from one's diet can transform the life of the reader, animals, and the planet. This book features contributions from such luminaries as Seth Godin, Joel Fuhrman, Victoria Moran, Jeffrey Sachs, Bill McKibben, Naomi Oreskes, Peter Singer, and others. With over 40 vegan, vegetarian, and \"less meat\" recipes from bestselling cookbook author Pat Crocker, as well as tons of practical tips for reducing the meat in your diet (for example, skip eating meat with dinner if you ate it with lunch; replace your favorite egg omelet with a tofu scramble; choose a veggie burrito instead of a beef burrito; declare a meatless day of the week), The Reducetarian Solution is a life--not to mention planet!--saving book.",

            "description": "The New York Times bestselling book coauthored by the Nobel Prize winner who discovered telomerase and telomeres' role in the aging process and the health psychologist who has done original research into how specific lifestyle and psychological habits can protect telomeres, slowing disease and improving life.Have you wondered why some sixty-year-olds look and feel like forty-year-olds and why some forty-year-olds look and feel like sixty-year-olds? While many factors contribute to aging and illness, Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn discovered a biological indicator called telomerase, the enzyme that replenishes telomeres, which protect our genetic heritage. Dr. Blackburn and Dr. Elissa Epel's research shows that the length and health of one's telomeres are a biological underpinning of the long-hypothesized mind-body connection. They and other scientists have found that changes we can make to our daily habits can protect our telomeres and increase our health spans (the number of years we remain healthy, active, and disease-free).THE TELOMERE EFFECT reveals how Blackburn and Epel's findings, together with research from colleagues around the world, cumulatively show that sleep quality, exercise, aspects of diet, and even certain chemicals profoundly affect our telomeres, and that chronic stress, negative thoughts, strained relationships, and even the wrong neighborhoods can eat away at them.Drawing from this scientific body of knowledge, they share lists of foods and suggest amounts and types of exercise that are healthy for our telomeres, mind tricks you can use to protect yourself from stress, and information about how to protect your children against developing shorter telomeres, from pregnancy through adolescence. And they describe how we can improve our health spans at the community level, with neighborhoods characterized by trust, green spaces, and safe streets.THE TELOMERE EFFECT will make you reassess how you live your life on a day-to-day basis. It is the first book to explain how we age at a cellular level and how we can make simple changes to keep our chromosomes and cells healthy, allowing us to stay disease-free longer and live more vital and meaningful lives.",

            "description": "An articulate call for animal rights, as well as a forceful and wide-ranging criticism of human abuse of animals.\u200dEvery cow simply wants to be content. Every bird yearns to be let free. Every bear, dog, or mouse feels grief and anguish in the same way that we people do. Matthieu Ricard takes the arguments from his best-selling books Altruism and Happiness to their logical conclusion: that compassion for all beings, including our fellow animals, is a moral obligation and the direction toward which any enlightened society must aspire in this compelling appeal to reason and human kindness. He documents the horrifying miseries of the animals we feed, dress, and use for \"entertainment,\" and challenges every conventional rationale for their exploitation with scientific facts and moral inquiry. What emerges is a clear and compelling ethical obligation to treat all creatures with respect and compassion with whom we share this world.",

            "description": "The implausible truth: Over one billion people in the world are hungry and over one billion are overweight. Far from complete opposites, hunger and obesity are in fact different manifestations of the same problem: It's increasingly difficult to find and eat nutritious food. By examining the global industrial food system using the deceptively simple template of a classic American dinner, We the Eaters not only outlines the root causes of this bizarre and troubling dichotomy but also provides a blueprint of actionable solutions\u2014solutions that could start with changing out just a single item on your plate.From your burger to your soda, Gustafson unpacks how even the hyperlocal can cause worldwide ripples. For instance: American agricultural policy promoting corn and soybeans in beef farming means we feed more to cows than to hungry people. This is compounded by the environmental cost of factory livestock farming, rising obesity rates, and the false economics of unhealthfully high meat consumption.The answer? Eat a hamburger\u2014just make it a smaller, sustainably raised, grass-fed one.Gustafson\u2014a young entrepreneur, foreign policy expert, and food policy advocate\u2014delivers a wake-up call that will inspire even the most passive reader to take action. We can love our food and our country while being better stewards of our system and our health. We the Eaters is nothing short of a manifesto: If we change dinner, we really can change the world.",

            "description": "How to Train As If Your VERY LIFE Depended on Your Degree of REAL Strength, Power and ToughnessMost physical training systems are designed for the domesticated human animal. That is to say, for us humans who live lives of such relative security that we cultivate our strength and power more out of pride and for a sense of accomplishment than out of an absolute need to survive in the wild. The professional athlete hones his body to function well in a sports event-rather than to emerge safe from a life-or-death struggle. And even those in our military and LEO rely more on the security of their weapons and armor than on their own personal, raw power and brute strength to carry the day.There remains one environment where exuding the necessary degree of authoritative strength and power can mean the difference between life or death: the maximum security prison. In maximum security, the predator preys on the weak like we breathe air. Intimidation is the daily currency. You either become a professional victim or you develop that supreme survival strength that signals the predator to stay at bay.Paul Wade spent 19 years in hell holes like San Quentin, Angola and Marion. He entered this world a gangly, terrorized weakling and he graduated to final freedom, pound-for-pound one of the strongest humans on the planet.Paul Wade dedicated his prison life to the cultivation of that supreme survival strength. And ironically, it is in America's prisons that we can find some of the great, lost secrets of how to get immensely powerful and strong. Paul Wade mined these secrets as if his life depended on it-and of course in many ways it did.Finally free, Paul Wade pays his debt to society-not just with the horrors of his years in the hole-but with the greatest gift he could possibly give us: a priceless set of progressions that can take ANYONE who has the will from abject weakling to strength specimen extraordinaire.",

It is the step-by-step manual to athletic superiority for men and women who take charge. The author became a world champion and record holder in a sport for which he had zero genetic predisposition--using the meticulously researched and professionally applied strategies he reveals on the pages of PSYCH.PSYCH and be awesome.--Pavel Tsatsouline, Chairman, StrongFirstFrom the Introduction to PSYCH by Dr. Judd Biasiotto\"When I first started powerlifting, I was at best a joke. In my first seven meets I finished dead last. I wasn't just beaten either, at times, I was absolutely destroyed. It wasn't uncommon for me to find myself two or three hundred pounds behind the leaders going into the deadlift. After the deadlift, well, the leaders weren't even in sight. I hate to admit this, but some guys could have beaten me without even benching. Their squat and deadlift totaled more than I totaled on all three lifts. Heck, at that time, even women and children could beat me. There was even a joke going around that the U.S.P.F. [powerlifting federation] was going to revoke my lifting card because I was impersonating a powerlifter. At least I think it was a joke. My little sister Mary Jean would say, 'Judd, you have to quit competing you are embarrassing the family.' She was serious.Obviously, I've come a long way in the sport. During my career, I had literally gone full circle-from one of the worst lifters to ever step on a lifting platform, to one of the best. And I did all that with a body that is not genetically constructed for powerlifting. In fact, it's been said that I have the body of an 11-year-old stamp collector and that my legs are so skinny they look like a pair of pliers in shorts.How did I do it? Well it wasn't the way I stacked or staggered some anabolic drug. In fact, I've never taken any drugs. The way I achieved world class status was through my mind. I learned to play the game of powerlifting above my shoulders. Through scientific means, I learned to take control of my environment, the people in it, and best yet; I've learned to take control of myself. The secret to my success and strength lies in these abilities.The best part of all this is that you can achieve these abilities just as I have. That's what this book is all about. It's designed as a learning manual and was written with the intent of presenting a systematic approach to prepare you for powerlifting competition.The methods in this book are based on scientifically validated research. They will work whether you believe in them or not. The only thing that is required is understanding and practice. If you apply the concepts outlined for you in this book, I flat guarantee you that your competition results will increase significantly. I'm not just blowing smoke here either; I'm speaking straight from the stone tablets.\"",

It expands upon Otto Warburg's well-known theory that all cancer is a disease of energy metabolism. \u00a0However, Warburg did not link his theory to the \"hallmarks of cancer\" and thus his theory was discredited.This book aims to provide evidence, through case studies, that cancer is primarily a metabolic disease requring metabolic solutions for its management and prevention. \u00a0Support for this position is derived from critical assessment of current cancer theories. \u00a0Brain cancer case studies are presented as a proof of principle for metabolic solutions to disease management, but similarities are drawn to other types of cancer, including breast and colon, due to the same cellular mutations that they demonstrate.",

The doctor-patient relationship--the heart of medicine--is broken: doctors are too distracted and overwhelmed to truly connect with their patients, and medical errors and misdiagnoses abound. In Deep Medicine, leading physician Eric Topol reveals how artificial intelligence can help. AI has the potential to transform everything doctors do, from notetaking and medical scans to diagnosis and treatment, greatly cutting down the cost of medicine and reducing human mortality. By freeing physicians from the tasks that interfere with human connection, AI will create space for the real healing that takes place between a doctor who can listen and a patient who needs to be heard.Innovative, provocative, and hopeful, Deep Medicine shows us how the awesome power of AI can make medicine better, for all the humans involved.",

            "description": "In this cookbook, America's Test Kitchen decodes and demystifies vegan cooking, so you can reap its many benefits and avoid the pitfalls of bland food, lack of variety, and overprocessed ingredients. You'll find approachable, fresh, vibrant recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and in between.Veganism is going mainstream. The benefits of consuming fewer animal products appear frequently in the news, and public figures and celebrities have openly embraced the tenets of a vegan diet, bringing it further into the food consciences of baby boomers, millennials, and postmillennials alike. Whether exploring a vegan diet for health, environmental, or political reasons, more and more people are looking to get hearty, plant-based meals onto their table. But eating vegan can seem overwhelming: Will it be flavorful? Satisfying? Easy to make? And it's easy to rely on processed foods.America's Test Kitchen addresses head-on what intimidates people: finding great-tasting and filling vegan protein options, cooking without dairy, preparing different whole grains and vegetables, and even baking. With more than 200 vibrant, foolproof recipes including proper day-starters, -cheesy- pizza you'll actually want to eat, filling vegetable-and-grain bowls, new dinner favorites, appetizers, DIY staples, and the ultimate birthday cake, this cookbook has something satisfying for everyone--the committed vegan or simply those looking to freshen up their cooking.",

            "description": "Charlie Engle\u2019s \u201cfascinating account of the high and low points of his life as an ultramarathon runner\u2026is uplifting and inspirational\u201d (Publishers Weekly) as he describes his globe-spanning races, his record-breaking run across the Sahara Desert, and how running helped him overcome drug addiction\u2014and an unjust stint in federal prison.After a decade-long addiction to crack cocaine and alcohol, Charlie Engle hit bottom with a near-fatal six-day binge that ended in a hail of bullets. As Engle got sober, he turned to running, which became his lifeline, his pastime, and his salvation. He began with marathons, and when marathons weren\u2019t far enough, he began to take on ultramarathons, races that went for thirty-five, fifty, and sometimes hundreds of miles, traveling to some of the most unforgiving places on earth to race. The Matt Damon-produced documentary, Running the Sahara, followed Engle as he lead a team on a harrowing, record breaking 4,500-mile run across the Sahara Desert, which helped raise millions of dollars for charity.Charlie\u2019s growing notoriety led to an investigation and a subsequent unjust conviction for mortgage fraud for which he spent sixteen months in federal prison in Beckley, West Virginia. While in jail, Engle pounded the small prison track, running endlessly in circles. Soon his fellow inmates were joining him, struggling to keep their spirits up in dehumanizing circumstances.In Running Man, Charlie Engle tells the surprising, funny, and emotional story of his life, detailing his setbacks and struggles\u2014from coping with addiction to serving time in prison\u2014and how he blazed a path to freedom by putting one foot in front of the other. \u201cA fast-paced, well-written account of a man who accepts pain, pushes beyond imagined limits, and ultimately finds redemption and peace\u201d (Booklist), this is a raw and triumphant account about finding the threshold of human endurance, and transcending it.",

            "description": "An integrative approach to healing chronic autoimmune conditions by a doctor, researcher, and sufferer of progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) whose TEDx talk is already a web sensation.Like many physicians, Dr. Terry Wahls focused on treating her patients\u2019 ailments with drugs or surgical procedures\u2014until she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2000. Within three years, her back and stomach muscles had weakened to the point where she needed a tilt-recline wheelchair. Conventional medical treatments were failing her, and she feared that she would be bedridden for the rest of her life.Dr. Wahls began studying the latest research on autoimmune disease and brain biology, and decided to get her vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and essential fatty acids from the food she ate rather than pills and supplements. Dr. Wahl\u2019s adopted the nutrient-rich paleo diet, gradually refining and integrating it into a regimen of neuromuscular stimulation. First, she walked slowly, then steadily, and then she biked eighteen miles in a single day. In November 2011, Dr. Wahls shared her remarkable recovery in a TEDx talk that immediately went viral. Now, in The Wahls Protocol, she shares the details of the protocol that allowed her to reverse many of her symptoms, get back to her life, and embark on a new mission: to share the Wahls Protocol with others suffering from the ravages of multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune conditions.",

            "description": "Before the invention of insulin, type 1 diabetic (T1D) patients were advised to avoid sugar and starch (carbohydrate) and to eat a very low carb, ketogenic diet to control blood sugar.In contrast, modern advice is to eat carbohydrates and treat the resulting high blood sugar with large doses of insulin. This -eat carb and take more insulin- method increases the cost of diabetic care and does nothing to protect the patient from symptoms and complications. Worse, it exposes T1D patients to the real danger of a fatally low blood-sugar episode (hypoglycemia).The logical solution is to reduce both carb intake and insulin dosage. Avoiding carbs while enjoying foods rich in healthy fats and protein stabilizes blood sugar and reduces medication costs and the risk of long-term complications.The Ketogenic Diet for Type 1 Diabetes provides the tools and information you need to successfully take control of your diabetes. In addition to clear explanations of the science, you'll find personal success stories, lists of the foods to eat and to avoid, cooking tips, how to get started and personalize the diet, adapting basal and bolus insulin doses, and special considerations for children with T1D.",

Fascinated by the sport of freediving\u2014in which competitors descend great depths on a single breath\u2014James Nestor embeds with a gang of oceangoing extreme athletes and renegade researchers. He finds whales that communicate with other whales hundreds of miles away, sharks that swim in unerringly straight lines through pitch-black waters, and other strange phenomena. Most illuminating of all, he learns that these abilities are reflected in our own remarkable, and often hidden, potential\u2014including echolocation, directional sense, and the profound bodily changes humans undergo when underwater. Along the way, Nestor unlocks his own freediving skills as he communes with the pioneers who are expanding our definition of what is possible in the natural world, and in ourselves.\u201cA journey well worth taking.\u201d \u2014David Epstein, New York Times Book Review\u201cNestor pulls us below the surface into a world far beyond imagining and opens our eyes to these unseen places.\u201d \u2014Dallas Morning News\u201cThis is popular science writing at its best.\u201d \u2014Christian Science Monitor",

            "description": "In his acclaimed national best seller, \"A Fighter s Heart,\" Sam Sheridan took readers with him as he stepped through the ropes into the dangerous world of professional fighting. From a muay Thai bout in Bangkok to Rio, where he trained with jiu-jitsu royalty, to Iowa, where he matched up against the toughest in MMA, Sheridan threw himself into a quest to understand how and why we fight. In \"The Fighter s Mind,\" Sheridan does for the brain what his first book did for the body. To uncover the secrets of mental strength and success, Sheridan interviewed dozens of the world s most fascinating and dangerous men, including celebrated trainers Freddie Roach and Greg Jackson; champion fighters Randy Couture, Frank Shamrock, and Marcelo Garcia; ultrarunner David Horton; legendary wrestler Dan Gable, and many more. What are their secrets? How do they stay committed through years of training, craft a game plan, and adjust to the realities of the ring? How do they project strength when weak, and remain mentally tough despite incredible physical pain? A fascinating book, bursting at the seams with incredible stories and insight, \"The Fighter s Mind\" answers these questions and many more.",

            "description": "Deborah Madison, America's leading vegetarian cooking authority and author of Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone, reveals the surprising connections between vegetables, edible flowers, and herbs within the same botanical families in her latest cookbook, and how understanding these connections can help home cooks see everyday vegetables in a new light. Deborah Madison has been at the forefront of the vegetarian culinary movement for nearly three decades, producing classic books on the topic and inspiring millions of readers to create simple, beautiful plant-based meals.Madison's crowning achievement is this innovative new cookbook, which is a celebration of the plant kingdom's richness and an examination of the interesting links between crops, edible flowers, herbs, and common wild plants within the same botanical families.Vegetable Literacy, destined to become the new standard reference for cooking vegetables, demonstrates to cooks how vegetables from the same family may be used interchangeably in cooking due to related qualities. Madison's broad understanding of cooking, gardening, and botany is used to provide a totally new perspective on veggies. Knowing that dill, chervil, cumin, parsley, coriander, anise, lovage, and caraway are all members of the umbellifer family, it's easy to see why they're such fantastic partners for carrots. Madison pulls this wealth of information together in dishes that emphasize a world of complementing flavors with more than 300 traditional and wonderfully easy recipes.Vegetable Literacy\u2014an unmatched look at gourmet vegetables and plants\u2014will permanently transform the way we eat and prepare, inspiring creativity in the kitchen and inquiry in the garden.",

            "description": "The first yoga text to outline a step-by-step sequence for developing a complete practice according to viniyoga--yoga adapted to the needs of the individual. A contemporary classic by a world-renowned teacher. This new edition adds thirty-two poems by Krishnamacharya that capture the essence of his teachings.Sri Tirumalai Krishnamacharya was one of the finest yogis of the contemporary age, living to be over 100 years old. Through the work of B. K. S. Iyengar, Pattabhi Jois, and Indra Devi, all of whom trained under Krishnamacharya, elements of Krishnamacharya's teaching have become well-known across the world. T. K. V. Desikachar, Krishnamacharya's son, has spent his whole life studying and practising with his father and now teaches the complete range of Krishnamacharya's yoga. Desikachar's technique is founded on Krishnamacharya's essential notion of viniyoga, which states that in order to obtain maximum therapeutic effectiveness, practices must be continuously tailored to the individual's changing requirements.Desikachar distils his father's theory as well as his own practical approach in The Heart of Yoga, which he characterizes as \"a regimen for the spine at every level\u2014physical, mental, and spiritual.\" This is the first yoga book to lay out a step-by-step plan for building a full practice based on yoga's age-old principals. Desikachar covers all aspects of yoga, including poses and counterposes, mindful breathing, meditation, and philosophy, and demonstrates how a yoga student may adjust his or her practice to his or her present health, age, work, and lifestyle.",

            "description": "In the last nine years alone, more than 100,000 people have lost their lives to drug-war violence in Mexico. 50 years ago, governments around the world made it illegal to produce, sell, and possess certain drugs. Five decades later, illegal drug use is at an all time high and $100 billion of government money around the globe is spent every year on drug-related criminal law enforcement and the so-called war on drugs. Drug prohibition laws have put the drug market into the hands of organized criminals, and the Global Commission on Drug Policy (GCDP) are seeking to alter opinion towards prohibition-focused drug laws and criminalization, bringing to light potential new policies and attitudes which will reduce organized crime, drug-related violence, and the supply and demand of illicit drugs.Harm reduction is at the forefront of their agenda and this collection of essays outlines key facts, debates, and perspectives on the war on drugs, and how we can end it. Contributors include Ernesto Zedillo (former president of Mexico), Ruth Dreifuss (former president of Switzerland), Henrique Fernando Cardoso (former president of Brazil), Olusegun Obasanjo (former president of Nigeria), Cesar Gaviria (former president of Colombia), Pavel Bem (former mayor of Prague), Michel Kazatchkine (UNSG\u2019s Special Envoy on HIV/AIDS in Eastern Europe and Central Asia), Anand Grover (former UN Special Rapporteur on the right to health), Carl Hart (Professor, Columbia University), and George Soros (philanthropist).",

            "description": "Former NBA star and Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient Kareem Abdul-Jabbar explores his 50-year friendship with Coach John Wooden, one of the most enduring and meaningful relationships in sports history.When future NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was still an 18-year-old high school basketball prospect from New York City named Lew Alcindor, he accepted a scholarship from UCLA largely on the strength of Coach John Wooden's reputation as a winner. It turned out to be the right choice, as Alcindor and his teammates won an unprecedented three NCAA championship titles. But it also marked the beginning of one of the most extraordinary and enduring friendships in the history of sports. In COACH WOODEN AND ME, Abdul-Jabbar reveals the inspirational story of how his bond with John Wooden evolved from a history-making coach-player mentorship into a deep and genuine friendship that transcended sports, shaped the course of both men's lives, and lasted for half a century.COACH WOODEN AND ME is a stirring tribute to the subtle but profound influence that Wooden had on Kareem as a player, and then as a person, as they began to share their cultural, religious, and family values while facing some of life's biggest obstacles. From his first day of practice, when the players were taught the importance of putting on their athletic socks properly; to gradually absorbing the sublime wisdom of Coach Wooden's now famous \"Pyramid of Success\"; to learning to cope with the ugly racism that confronted black athletes during the turbulent Civil Rights era as well as losing loved ones, Abdul-Jabbar fondly recalls how Coach Wooden's fatherly guidance not only paved the way for his unmatched professional success but also made possible a lifetime of personal fulfillment.Full of intimate, never-before-published details and delivered with the warmth and erudition of a grateful student who has learned his lessons well, COACH WOODEN AND ME is at once a celebration of the unique philosophical outlook of college basketball's most storied coach and a moving testament to the all-conquering power of friendship.",

How does the mind differ from the brain? Though the mind\u2019s contents\u2015its emotions, thoughts, and memories\u2015are often described, the essence of mind is rarely, if ever, defined.In this book, noted neuropsychiatrist and New York Times best-selling author Daniel J. Siegel, MD, uses his characteristic sensitivity and interdisciplinary background to offer a definition of the mind that illuminates the how, what, when, where, and even why of who we are, of what the mind is, and what the mind\u2019s self has the potential to become. MIND takes the reader on a deep personal and scientific journey into consciousness, subjective experience, and information processing, uncovering the mind\u2019s self-organizational properties that emerge from both the body and the relationships we have with one another, and with the world around us. While making a wide range of sciences accessible and exciting\u2015from neurobiology to quantum physics, anthropology to psychology\u2015this book offers an experience that addresses some of our most pressing personal and global questions about identity, connection, and the cultivation of well-being in our lives. 55 illustrations",

            "description": "Pete Sampras is arguably the greatest tennis player ever, a man whose hard-nosed work ethic led to an unprecedented number one world ranking for 286 weeks, and whose prodigious talent made possible a record-setting fourteen Grand Slam titles. While his more vocal rivals sometimes grabbed the headlines, Pete always preferred to let his racket do the talking.Until now.In A Champion\u2019s Mind, the tennis great who so often exhibited visible discomfort with letting people \u201cinside his head\u201d finally opens up. An athletic prodigy, Pete resolved from his earliest playing days never to let anything get in the way of his love for the game. But while this single-minded determination led to tennis domination, success didn\u2019t come without a price. The constant pressure of competing on the world\u2019s biggest stage\u2014in the unblinking eye of a media machine hungry for more than mere athletic greatness\u2014took its toll.Here for the first time Pete speaks freely about what it was like to possess what he calls \u201cthe Gift.\u201d He writes about the personal trials he faced\u2014including the death of a longtime coach and confidant\u2014and the struggles he gutted his way through while being seemingly on top of the world. Among the book\u2019s most riveting scenes are an early devastating loss to Stefan Edberg that led Pete to make a monastic commitment to delivering on his natural talent; a grueling, four-hour-plus match against Alex Corretja during which Pete became seriously ill; fierce on-court battles with rival and friend Andre Agassi; and the triumphant last match of Pete\u2019s career at the finals of the 2002 U.S. Open.In A Champion\u2019s Mind, one of the most revered, successful, and intensely private players in the history of tennis offers an intimate look at the life of an elite athlete.",

            "description": "Now in paperback, with photos and maps added especially for this new edition, here is the acclaimed life story of a woman whose drive and determination inspire everyone she touches.Lynne Cox started swimming almost as soon as she could walk. By age sixteen, she had broken all records for swimming the English Channel. Her daring eventually led her to the Bering Strait, where she swam five miles in thirty-eight-degree water in just a swimsuit, cap, and goggles. In between those accomplishments, she became the first to swim the Strait of Magellan, narrowly escaped a shark attack off the Cape of Good Hope, and was cheered across the twenty-mile Cook Strait of New Zealand by dolphins. She even swam a mile in the Antarctic.Lynne writes the same way she swims, with indefatigable spirit and joy, and shares the beauty of her time in the water with a poet's eye for detail. She has accomplished yet another feat--writing a new classic of sports memoir.",

            "description": "This is Morton Meyers' fascinating, entertaining, and highly accessible look at the surprising role serendipity played in some of the most important medical discoveries in the 20th century. Though within the scientific community a certain stigma is attached to chance discovery because it is wrongly seen as pure luck, happy accidents happen every day and Meyers shows how it takes intelligence, insight, and creativity to recognize a \"Eureka! I found what I wasn't look for!\" moment and know what to do next. Penicillin, chemotherapy drugs, X-rays, Valium, the Pap smear, and Viagra were all discovered accidentally, stumbled upon in search of something else. In discussing these medical breakthroughs and others, Dr. Meyers makes a cogent, highly engaging argument for a more creative, rather than purely linear, approach to science.",

            "description": "From the National Magazine Award-winning Runner\u2019s World columnist, frequent New Yorker online contributor, and Cambridge-trained physicist: a fascinating and definitive exploration of the extraordinary science of human endurance and the secrets of human performance, for fans of The Sports Gene, Born to Run, and Grit.From running a two-hour marathon to summiting Mount Everest, we\u2019re fascinated by the extremes of human endurance, constantly testing both our physical and psychological limits.How high or far or fast can humans go? And what about individual potential: what defines a person\u2019s limits?For years, physiology determined the answer: heart size, lung capacity, and muscle strength. But over the past decade, a wave of dramatic findings in the cutting-edge science of endurance has completely overturned our understanding of human limitation. Endure widely disseminates these findings for the first time: It\u2019s the brain that dictates how far we can go\u2014which means we can always push ourselves further.Hutchinson presents an overview of science\u2019s search for understanding human fatigue, from crude experiments with electricity and frogs\u2019 legs to sophisticated brain imaging technology. Going beyond the traditional mechanical view of human limits (like a car with a brick on its gas pedal, we go until the tank runs out of gas), he instead argues that a key element in endurance is how the brain responds to distress signals\u2014whether heat, or cold, or muscles screaming with lactic acid\u2014and reveals that we can train to improve brain response.An elite distance runner himself, Hutchinson takes us to the forefront of the new sports psychology\u2014brain electrode jolts, computer-based training, subliminal messaging\u2014and presents startling new discoveries enhancing the performance of athletes today and shows how anyone can utilize these tactics to bolster their own performance\u2014and get the most out of their bodies.",

            "description": "A new twist on keto: The fat-burning power of ketogenic eating meets the clean green benefits of a plant-centric plate.The keto craze is just getting warmed up. The ketogenic diet kick-starts your body's metabolism so it burns fat, instead of sugar, as its primary fuel. But most ketogenic plans are meat- and dairy-heavy, creating a host of other problems, especially for those who prefer plants at the center of the plate. Dr. Will Cole comes to the rescue with Ketotarian, which has all the fat-burning benefits without the antibiotics and hormones that are packed into most keto diets.First developed for individuals suffering from seizures, keto diets have been shown to reduce inflammation and lower the risk of many chronic health problems including Alzheimer's and some cancers. Adding a plant-based twist, Ketotarian includes more than 75 recipes that are vegetarian, vegan, or pescatarian, offering a range of delicious and healthy choices for achieving weight loss, renewed health, robust energy, and better brain function.Packed with expert tips, tricks, and advice for going--and staying--Ketotarian, including managing macronutrients, balancing electrolytes, and finding your carb sweet spot, this best-of-both-worlds program is a game-changer for anyone who wants to tame inflammation and achieve peak physical and mental performance. Let the Ketotarian revolution begin!",

            "description": "The ketogenic diet is a natural, nontoxic metabolic therapy being studied and utilized for cancer prevention and treatment. It works because cancer cells are dependent upon a constant supply of blood sugar (glucose) to stay alive. Normal cells can make energy from both glucose and ketones (metabolic by-products of burning fat), but most cancer cells can only use glucose. Avoiding carbohydrates (starch and sugar) while enjoying delicious and healthy protein and fats will lower blood glucose and increase blood-ketone levels, resulting in a normal body state called nutritional ketosis. Research has shown that nutritional ketosis starves cancer cells while nourishing normal cells and strengthening total body health.This essential, fully referenced book is a practical guide for physicians, patients and caregivers, and provides step-by-step instructions for customizing the diet and clear explanations of the cutting-edge research on ketogenic therapies being done by Dr. Dominic D\u2019Agostino\u2019s team at the University of South Florida and Dr. Thomas Seyfried\u2019s team at Boston College. The ketogenic diet for cancer is based on the consumption of whole, fresh foods and it can be used in addition to standard care or as a stand-alone treatment in wait-and-see situations.The first edition of this book was released in 2012 and was the first book written to help the patient. It has been updated as the research has developed, and the body of scientific evidence continues to grow. Metabolic therapy is cutting edge, and thousands of people have purchased and used the information in this book to take back some control over their own health. You can too.",

They're remarkably simple to prepare (all you need are a few simple ingredients and a basic dehydrator), and in as little as twenty minutes, you can have an assortment of tasty fresh cheeses fit for any occasion. Even creating aged cheeses is easy--they require only a day or two in the dehydrator, so making \"fancier\" cheeses, like Aged Almond Cheddar, is an almost entirely hands-off process. And though they're delectable on their own, Julie's nut-based cheeses are a terrific component in her recipes for Raw Beet Ravioli with Cashew Truffle Cream, Country Veggie Lasagna with Fennel and Brazil Nut Pesto, French Onion Soup with Cashew Camembert, and more. Filled with the essential tips, tools, and mouth-watering recipes home cooks need to immerse themselves in the world of nut-based cheese-making, This Cheese is Nuts will demonstrate why nut cheeses should be part of any healthy, sustainable diet.",

            "description": "A follow-up to Matt Haig's internationally bestselling memoir, Reasons to Stay Alive, a broader look at how modern life feeds our anxiety, and how to live a better life.The societies we live in are increasingly making our minds ill, making it feel as though the way we live is engineered to make us unhappy. When Matt Haig developed panic disorder, anxiety, and depression as an adult, it took him a long time to work out the ways the external world could impact his mental health in both positive and negative ways. Notes on a Nervous Planet collects his observations, taking a look at how the various social, commercial and technological \"advancements\" that have created the world we now live in can actually hinder our happiness. Haig examines everything from broader phenomena like inequality, social media, and the news; to things closer to our daily lives, like how we sleep, how we exercise, and even the distinction we draw between our minds and our bodies.",

Even when their kids' schedules pull them in eighteen different directions. They are not superhuman. They are not from another planet.With simple strategies and common sense, Jenny figured out how to break down dinner\u2014the food, the timing, the anxiety, from prep to cleanup\u2014so that her family could enjoy good food, time to unwind, and simply be together.Using the same straight-up, inspiring voice that readers of her award-winning blog, Dinner: A Love Story, have come to count on, Jenny never judges and never preaches. Every meal she dishes up is a real meal, one that has been cooked and eaten and enjoyed at least a half dozen times by someone in Jenny's house. With inspiration and game plans for any home cook at any level, Dinner: A Love Story is as much for the novice who doesn't know where to start as it is for the gourmand who doesn't know how to start over when she finds herself feeding an intractable toddler or for the person who never thought about home-cooked meals until he or she became a parent. This book is, in fact, for anyone interested in learning how to make a meal to be shared with someone they love, and about how so many good, happy things happen when we do.",

            "description": "A visionary and completely original investigation that will change the way we think about health care: how and why it is failing, why expanding insurance coverage will only make things worse, and how it can be transformed into a transparent, affordable, successful system.In 2007, David Goldhill's father died from a series of infections acquired in a well-regarded New York hospital. The bill was for several hundred thousand dollars--and Medicare paid it. These circumstances left Goldhill angry and determined to understand how it was possible that world-class technology and well-trained personnel could result in such simple, inexcusable carelessness--and how a business that failed so miserably could be rewarded with full payment. Catastrophic Care is the eye-opening result. Goldhill explicates a health-care system that now costs nearly $2.5 trillion annually, bars many from treatment, provides inconsistent quality of care, offers negligible customer service, and in which an estimated 200,000 Americans die each year from errors. Above all, he exposes the fundamental fallacy of our entire system--that Medicare and insurance coverage make care cheaper and improve our health--and suggests a comprehensive new approach that could produce better results at more acceptable costs immediately by giving us, the patients, a real role in the process.",

            "description": "Richard Olney - responsible for the legendary Time-Life cooking series as well as other cooking classics such as his wonderful Simple French Food (also published by Grub Street) -- moved to Provence in 1961 and had the good fortune to befriend Lulu and Lucien Peyraud, the owners of the noted Domaine Tempier vineyard in Provence, not far from Marseilles. Lulu's Provencal Table tantalizes the reader with Olney's descriptions of the regional food served as the vineyard meals at the Domaine. Then he lovingly transcribes Lulu's recipes. She has an empathy with and understanding of Provencal ingredients that is inspirational.There is succulent Pot-Roasted Leg of Lamb with Black Olives served with Courgette Gratin, and Potato and Sorrel Gratin, delicious with just six ingredients. There are plenty of simple recipes, but the recipe for bouillabaisse is a fascinating 10 pages long. Her 150 recipes read like a roll call of the best of Provence \u0336 tapenade, anchoiade, brandade, pissaladiere, bagna cauda, sardines grillees, bouillabaisse, bourride, daurade au fenouil, daube, gigot a la ficelle and ratatouille. Starting with aperitifs and amuse-gueule and finishing up with fruit desserts, hers is classic French country cooking, featuring everyday ingredients cooked with respect for their nature and flavor. Having been described as 'a gastronomic love poem to France's most exhilarating region, ' this is an essential book for any serious food lover's library.",

            "description": "\"As lively, thorough, and engaging as the team it chronicles\" (Nathaniel Friedman), Betaball is a compelling look at how the Golden State Warriors embraced savvy business practices, next generation science, and Silicon Valley's technocentric culture not only to produce one of the greatest basketball teams in history but also to revolutionize the NBA--perfect for fans of Moneyball and The Book of Basketball.Betaball is the definitive, inside account of how the Golden State Warriors, under the ownership of venture capitalist Joe Lacob and Hollywood producer Peter Guber, quickly became one of the greatest success stories in both sports and business.In just five years, they turned a declining franchise with no immediate hope into the NBA's dominant force--and facilitated the rise of All-Star point guard Stephen Curry. By operating in \"beta,\" the Warriors morphed into a model organization for American professional sports, instituting the best workplace principles found inside the world's most successful corporations, and instilling a top-down organizational ethos that allows employees--from the front office to the free-throw line--to thrive.With in-depth access and meticulous reporting on and off the court, acclaimed journalist Erik Malinowski recounts a gripping tale of a team's reinvention, of worlds colliding, of ordinary people being pushed to extraordinary heights, and the Golden State Warriors' chase for a second straight NBA championship during the 2015-'16 season. Betaball is \"a book for fans of all sports and science, business and analytics, Silicon Valley and Wall Street, front offices and locker rooms, money and winning\" (Don Van Natta Jr., ESPN reporter and New York Times bestselling author).",

            "description": "Dan Rooney was one of the most powerful sports executives of his time, having built the Pittsburgh Steelers into one of the NFL's most illustrious dynasties and elite clubs. However, some of his most significant accomplishments were off the field, as he worked to improve the league's employment processes and restore peace to his ancestral nation of Ireland. Dan Rooney was noted for his basic convictions, quiet strength, effectiveness, and willingness to talk to and listen to people who disagreed with him as a corporate leader, philanthropist, diplomat, and creator of the famous Rooney Rule.Jim Rooney takes readers behind the scenes in this moving chronicle of his father's life, sharing experiences from his hundreds of hours of interviews with corporate and government leaders, sports and celebrity influences, and family members. A Different Way to Win is a memoir, a business biography, and a history book that emphasizes the significance of focusing on the long game and the success of establishing agreement in a meaningful and long-term manner",

            "description": "Dr. Fuhrman's innovative six-week strategy is supported by current scientific research in the Eat To Live 2011 revised version, which now contains a brand new chapter addressing Dr. Fuhrman's discoveries of toxic hunger and the role of food addiction in weight disorders. This new chapter offers fresh and significant perspectives on weight increase. It describes how and why eating the incorrect foods generates poisonous hunger and the urge to consume excessive calories, but eating a diet rich in micronutrients causes real hunger, which reduces the feelings that lead to food cravings and overeating. It teaches readers how to overcome the discomfort of poisonous hunger, cravings, and harmful food addictions.This is a book that will help you live longer, use fewer prescriptions, and radically improve your health. It is a book that will alter your eating habits. Most importantly, sticking to the Eat To Live diet can help you lose weight faster than you ever imagined.\u200d\u200d\u200d",

            "description": "What makes us cross the line from waking to slumber? According to Harvard scientists it's our 'sleep switch' - a cluster of neurons in the hypothalamus. For the ancient Greeks it was the god Hypnos, caressing you with his wings. For the Blackfeet Indians, a butterfly. And in European children's tales, the Sandman, sprinkling you with dust.Why do we sleep? What happens in our brains when we sleep? Why are sleep patterns in modern Western industrialised countries so unhealthy? Is the boundary between sleep and wakefulness as clear cut as we might have supposed? How meaningful are dreams? Kat Duff brings insights from her own life, from the latest in sleep science, the paintings of Salvidor Dali, the musings of Michel de Montaigne, and wisdom and rituals from around the world and the past to paint a fascinating picture of a world that is both the most intimate and the most secret to us: sleep.",

            "description": "An eye-opening exploration of blood, the lifegiving substance with the power of taboo, the value of diamonds, and the promise of breakthrough scienceBlood carries life, yet the sight of it makes people faint. It is a waste product and a commodity pricier than oil. It can save lives and transmit deadly infections. Each one of us has roughly nine pints of it, yet many don\u2019t even know their own blood type. And for all its ubiquity, the few tablespoons of blood discharged by 800 million women are still regarded as taboo; menstruation is perhaps the single most demonized biological event.Rose George, author of The Big Necessity, is renowned for her intrepid work on topics that are invisible but vitally important. In Nine Pints, she takes us from ancient practices of bloodletting to modern \u201chemovigilance\u201d teams that track blood-borne diseases. She introduces Janet Vaughan, who set up the world\u2019s first system of mass blood donation during the Blitz, and Arunachalam Muruganantham, known as \u201cMenstrual Man\u201d for his work on sanitary pads for developing countries. She probes the lucrative business of plasma transfusions, in which the U.S. is known as the \u201cOPEC of plasma.\u201d And she looks to the future, as researchers seek to bring synthetic blood to a hospital near you.Spanning science and politics, stories and global epidemics, Nine Pints reveals our life's blood in an entirely new light.",

Ed Yong, whose humor is as evident as his erudition, prompts us to look at ourselves and our animal companions in a new light\u2014less as individuals and more as the interconnected, interdependent multitudes we assuredly are.The microbes in our bodies are part of our immune systems and protect us from disease. In the deep oceans, mysterious creatures without mouths or guts depend on microbes for all their energy. Bacteria provide squid with invisibility cloaks, help beetles to bring down forests, and allow worms to cause diseases that afflict millions of people.Many people think of microbes as germs to be eradicated, but those that live with us\u2014the microbiome\u2014build our bodies, protect our health, shape our identities, and grant us incredible abilities. In this astonishing book, Ed Yong takes us on a grand tour through our microbial partners, and introduces us to the scientists on the front lines of discovery. It will change both our view of nature and our sense of where we belong in it.",

            "description": "Because, \"The Hockey Handbook\" was the first comprehensive, technical book ever written about hockey. It is still regarded as the classic reference book for hockey players, coaches and spectators. Lloyd Percival wrote this book in 1950, after studying sports coaching under Knute Rockne, and in Prague and London. It was initially scoffed at (one NHL coach called it \"the product of a three-year old mind\"), but Percival was unusually prophetic. European and Soviet teams adopted this book as a textbook for their hockey development, and it contributed to Russian and Czech teams dominating world hockey championships for a generation.The principles described in the original book are still valid, and Percival was so well versed in sports training that many sections needed only little alteration. Still, in this updated edition, Wayne Major and Robert Thom, along with other experts in hockey coaching, provide the most current information on techniques of play, conditioning, nutrition and power skating. This book is now a must for coaches for all age groups, players who want to improve, parents of young players and every fan who wants to learn more about the game of hockey.",

And these escape attempts only hurt the people men love and pass their condition on to their children.This groundbreaking book is the \u201cpathway out of darkness\u201d that these men and their families seek. Real reveals how men can unearth their pain, heal themselves, restore relationships, and break the legacy of abuse. He mixes penetrating analysis with compelling tales of his patients and even his own experiences with depression as the son of a violent, depressed father and the father of two young sons.",

In 2014, the Astros were the worst baseball team in half a century, but just three years later they defied critics to win a stunning World Series. In this book, Ben Reiter shows how the Astros built a system that avoided the stats-versus-scouts divide by giving the human factor a key role in their decision-making. Sitting at the nexus of sports, business, and innovation, Astroball is the story of the next wave of thinking in baseball and beyond, at once a remarkable underdog tale and a fascinating look at the cutting edge of evaluating and optimizing human potential.",

Includes recipes.Chefs have been playing the \"My Last Supper\" game among themselves for decades, if not centuries, but it had always been kept within the profession-until now. Melanie Dunea came up with the ingenious idea to ask fifty of the world's famous chefs to let her in on this insider's game and tell her what their final meals would be. My Last Supper showcases their fascinating answers alongside stunning Vanity Fair-style portraits. Their responses are surprising, refreshing, and as distinct from each other as the chefs themselves. The portraits-gorgeous, intimate, and playful-are informed by their answers and reveal the passions and personalities of the most respected names in the business. Lastly, one recipe from each landmark meal is included in the back of the book.With My Last Supper, Dunea found a way into the typically harried, hidden minds of the people who have turned preparing food into an art. Who wouldn't want to know where Alain Ducasse would like his last supper to be? And who would prepare Daniel Boulud's final meal? What would Anthony Bourdain's guest list look like? As the clock ticked, what album would Gordon Ramsay be listening to? And just what would Mario Batali eat for the last time?Featuring: Ferran Adri\u00e0, Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, Dan Barber, Lidia Bastianich, Mario Batali, Rick Bayless, Michelle Bernstein, Daniel Boulud, Anthony Bourdain, Scott Conant, Gary Danko, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Darroze, Alain Ducasse, Wylie Dufresne, Suzanne Goin, Gabrielle Hamilton, Fergus Henderson, Thomas Keller, Giorgio Locatelli, Masa Kobayashi, Nobu, Jamie Oliver, Jacques P\u00e9pin, Gordon Ramsay, Michel Richard, Eric Ripert, Marcus Samuelsson, Charlie Trotter, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, and more...",

            "description": "Bill Walton's inspirational biography recalls his catastrophic injuries and miraculous recoveries, set against the backdrop of his UCLA victories under John Wooden, his renowned NBA career, and his love of music and the Grateful Dead.Bill Walton experienced a devastating spinal collapse in February 2008, rendering him unable to move. This was the culmination of a lifetime of injuries. He spent three years eating his meals on the floor of his residence and crawling to the bathroom, where he could barely get up onto the toilet. Walton was put to the test by the intense agony and lengthy recuperation. He healed, thanks to tremendous patience, courage, drive, and sacrifice\u2014as well as groundbreaking surgery\u2014and now recounts his life experience in this astonishing and one-of-a-kind biography.Walton was strongly inspired by the political and cultural revolutions of the 1950s and 1960s as he grew up in San Diego. Outside of his family, his greatest role model outside of music and politics was super-straight UCLA basketball coach John Wooden, a serious, disciplined mentor who seemed impervious to the tumult of the times. Despite their constant tension and strife, the two men spoke almost every day for forty-three years, until Wooden's death at the age of ninety-nine.Walton selected a career in broadcasting when his playing days ended, despite a lifelong stuttering problem. He went on to win an Emmy Award and other awards for broadcasting, and he became a well-known media commentator.No brilliance, according to John Wooden, has ever come without a cost. The true tale of Walton's life exemplifies this adage perfectly. Back from the Dead tells his remarkable narrative in his own words, including his basketball and broadcasting careers, as well as his numerous losses and comebacks, and his ultimate triumph as the hardest of champions.",

Julia Child and Jacques P\u00e9pin are synonymous with good food, and in these pages they demonstrate techniques (on which they don\u2019t always agree), discuss ingredients, improvise, balance flavors to round out a meal, and conjure up new dishes from leftovers. Center stage are carefully spelled-out recipes flanked by Julia\u2019s and Jacques\u2019s comments\u2014the accumulated wisdom of two lifetimes of honing their cooking skills. Nothing is written in stone, they imply. And that is one of the most important lessons for every good cook.Throughout this richly illustrated book you\u2019ll see Julia\u2019s and Jacques\u2019s hands at work, and you\u2019ll sense the pleasure the two are having cooking together, tasting, exchanging ideas, and raising a glass to savor the fruits of their labor. Again and again they demonstrate that cooking is endlessly fascinating and challenging and, while ultimately personal, it is a joy to be shared.",

            "description": "Ever wondered how to pan-fry a steak with a charred crust and an interior that's perfectly medium-rare from edge to edge when you cut into it? How to make homemade mac 'n' cheese that is as satisfyingly gooey and velvety-smooth as the blue box stuff, but far tastier? How to roast a succulent, moist turkey (forget about brining!)\u2014and use a foolproof method that works every time?As Serious Eats's culinary nerd-in-residence, J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt has pondered all these questions and more. In The Food Lab, Kenji focuses on the science behind beloved American dishes, delving into the interactions between heat, energy, and molecules that create great food. Kenji shows that often, conventional methods don\u2019t work that well, and home cooks can achieve far better results using new\u2014but simple\u2014techniques. In hundreds of easy-to-make recipes with over 1,000 full-color images, you will find out how to make foolproof Hollandaise sauce in just two minutes, how to transform one simple tomato sauce into a half dozen dishes, how to make the crispiest, creamiest potato casserole ever conceived, and much more.",

            "description": "We start out with the best intentions. We're going to exercise more and get in shape! Then five days a week at the gym turns into two... then becomes none. We hit the snooze button and skip the morning run.We really do want to be healthy and fit, but we're over whelmed and overextended\u2014and exercise feels like another chore to complete. Is it any wonder we don't stick with it? Behavior expert Michelle Segar has devoted her career to the science of motivation. In No Sweat, she reveals that while \"better health\" or \"weight loss\" sound like strong incentives, human beings are hardwired to choose immediate gratification over delayed benefits. In other words, we're not going to exercise unless it makes us happy right now.So what's the solution? To achieve lasting fitness, we have to change our minds\u2014before we can change our bodies. In No Sweat, Segar shows us how. Translating twenty years of research on exercise and motivation into a simple four-point program, she helps readers broaden their definition of exercise, find pleasure in physical activity, and discover realistic ways to fit it into their lives. Activities we enjoy, we repeat--making this evidence-based system more sustainable in the long run than a regimen of intense workouts. Even if we don't sweat, we really benefit.The success of the clients Segar has coached testifies to the power of her program. Their stories punctuate the book, entertaining and emboldening readers to break the cycle of exercise failure once and for all. Complete with worksheets, tips, and techniques, getting in shape has never been so easy\u2014or so much fun.",

The experience demolished her Western preconceptions of how we should live and led her to a radically different view of what human nature really is. She offers a new understanding of how we have lost much of our natural well-being and shows us practical ways to regain it for our children and for ourselves.",

            "description": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER.From a Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning investigative reporter at The New York Times comes the explosive story of the rise of the processed food industry and its link to the emerging obesity epidemic. Michael Moss reveals how companies use salt, sugar, and fat to addict us and, more important, how we can fight back.In the spring of 1999 the heads of the world\u2019s largest processed food companies\u2014from Coca-Cola to Nabisco\u2014gathered at Pillsbury headquarters in Minneapolis for a secret meeting. On the agenda: the emerging epidemic of obesity, and what to do about it.Increasingly, the salt-, sugar-, and fat-laden foods these companies produced were being linked to obesity, and a concerned Kraft executive took the stage to issue a warning: There would be a day of reckoning unless changes were made. This executive then launched into a damning PowerPoint presentation\u2014114 slides in all\u2014making the case that processed food companies could not afford to sit by, idle, as children grew sick and class-action lawyers lurked. To deny the problem, he said, is to court disaster.When he was done, the most powerful person in the room\u2014the CEO of General Mills\u2014stood up to speak, clearly annoyed. And by the time he sat down, the meeting was over.Since that day, with the industry in pursuit of its win-at-all-costs strategy, the situation has only grown more dire. Every year, the average American eats thirty-three pounds of cheese (triple what we ate in 1970) and seventy pounds of sugar (about twenty-two teaspoons a day). We ingest 8,500 milligrams of salt a day, double the recommended amount, and almost none of that comes from the shakers on our table. It comes from processed food. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that one in three adults, and one in five kids, is clinically obese. It\u2019s no wonder that twenty-six million Americans have diabetes, the processed food industry in the U.S. accounts for $1 trillion a year in sales, and the total economic cost of this health crisis is approaching $300 billion a year.In Salt Sugar Fat, Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning investigative reporter Michael Moss shows how we got here. Featuring examples from some of the most recognizable (and profitable) companies and brands of the last half century\u2014including Kraft, Coca-Cola, Lunchables, Kellogg, Nestl\u00e9, Oreos, Cargill, Capri Sun, and many more\u2014Moss\u2019s explosive, empowering narrative is grounded in meticulous, often eye-opening research.Moss takes us inside the labs where food scientists use cutting-edge technology to calculate the \u201cbliss point\u201d of sugary beverages or enhance the \u201cmouthfeel\u201d of fat by manipulating its chemical structure. He unearths marketing campaigns designed\u2014in a technique adapted from tobacco companies\u2014to redirect concerns about the health risks of their products: Dial back on one ingredient, pump up the other two, and tout the new line as \u201cfat-free\u201d or \u201clow-salt.\u201d He talks to concerned executives who confess that they could never produce truly healthy alternatives to their products even if serious regulation became a reality. Simply put: The industry itself would cease to exist without salt, sugar, and fat. Just as millions of \u201cheavy users\u201d\u2014as the companies refer to their most ardent customers\u2014are addicted to this seductive trio, so too are the companies that peddle them. You will never look at a nutrition label the same way again.",

            "description": "In the early 1990's I began writing for Stuart McRobert's Hardgainer magazine. In 1996, I published Dinosaur Training: Lost Secrets of Strength and Development. Since then, I've written and published more than 20 books and courses and written thousands of blog posts and articles on strength training, muscle building, weightlifting and Iron Game history, famous strongmen and how they trained, diet, nutrition, and the all-important mental aspects of strength training. I've edited and published close to 100 issues of The Dinosaur Files newsletter, which is now available in a journal-sized quarterly format, and I've put together over a dozen strength training DVD's. I've done close to 100 podcast interviews, delivered audio seminars, presented live seminars, and answered thousands of training questions from readers around the word. By conservative estimate, I've written well over one million words about strength training, muscle building and physical culture.I've done this\u2014and I continue to do it\u2014because I've made it my life's work to promote sane, sensible, result producing and effective strength training and muscle building\u2014and to teach and preserve the very best traditions of old-school physical culture. My goal is to teach as many people as possible about the kind of training that really works\u2014the kind of training that builds real-world strength, muscle and power, promotes life-long good health and develops the mind and the heart of a true champion.This book is the first in a series of books that will collect, collate and update all of the information in my other books, courses and articles. We're going to begin with a very important topic: the most effective exercises, and how to put them together into workouts and training programs that will build strength, muscle and power as rapidly and efficiently as possible. There is a wealth of valuable information in this book, and if you read, study and apply what you find within its pages, I have no doubt that you will enjoy great gains and rapid progress. I also believe that although your training will require plenty of hard work, you'll find your workouts to be fun and enjoyable. Human beings thrive when they meet and overcome challenges, and that makes old-school strength training an enormously rewarding activity for all of us.",

The good news is that social connection is innate and a cure for loneliness. In Together, the former Surgeon General will address the importance of community and connection and offer viable and actionable solutions to this overlooked epidemic.",

We no longer know for certain what is entering the food chain and what we are eating \u2013 as the UK horsemeat scandal demonstrated. We are reaching a tipping point as the farming revolution threatens our countryside, health and the quality of our food wherever we live in the world.Our health is under threat: half of all antibiotics used worldwide (rising to 80 per cent in US) are routinely given to industrially farmed animals, contributing to the emergence of deadly antibiotic-resistant superbugsWildlife is being systematically destroyed: bees are now trucked across the States (and even airfreighted from Australia) to pollinate the fruit trees in the vast orchards of California, where a chemical assault has decimated the wild insect populationCereals that could feed billions of people are being given to animals: soya and grain that could nourish the world's poorest, are now grown increasingly as animal fodder\u200dFarmageddon is a fascinating and terrifying investigative journey behind the closed doors of a runaway industry across the world \u2013 from the UK, Europe and the USA, to China, Argentina, Peru and Mexico. It is both a wake-up call to change our current food production and eating practices and an attempt to find a way to a better farming future.",

            "description": "Named Sports Illustrated's best football book of all time and a #1 NYT bestseller, this is the classic story of a high school football team whose win-loss record has a profound influence on the town around them.Return once again to the timeless account of the Permian Panthers of Odessa -- the winningest high-school football team in Texas history. Socially and racially divided, Odessa isn't known to be a place big on dreams, but every Friday night from September to December, when the Panthers play football, dreams can come true.With frankness and compassion, Pulitzer Prize winner H. G. Bissinger unforgettably captures a season in the life of Odessa and shows how single-minded devotion to the team shapes the community and inspires -- and sometimes shatters -- the teenagers who wear the Panthers' uniforms.The inspiration for the hit television program and film of the same name, this anniversary edition features a new afterword by the author.",

            "description": "You probably didn't realize that when you graduate from college you increase your lifespan, or that your co-worker who has a slightly better job is more likely to live a healthier life. In this groundbreaking book, epidemiologist Michael Marmot marshals evidence from nearly thirty years of research to demonstrate that status is not a footnote to the causes of ill health-it is the cause. He calls this effect the status syndrome.The status syndrome is pervasive. It determines the chances that you will succumb to heart disease, stroke, cancers, infectious diseases, even suicide and homicide. And the issue, as Marmot shows, is not simply one of income or lifestyle. It is the psychological experience of inequality-how much control you have over your life and the opportunities you have for full social participation-that has a profound effect on your health.The Status Syndrome will utterly change the way we think about health, society, and how we live our lives.",

The Happy Pear opened ten years ago when twins David and Stephen Flynn, passionate about starting a food revolution in their home town, took over their local fruit and veg shop and later opened a caf\u00e9. Their revolution has not only succeeded, but it is spreading, and the Happy Pear's fans range from young parents to pensioners, ladies-who-lunch to teens-on-the-run, Electric Picnickers to Hollywood stars. David and Stephen's first cookbook is full of irresistible recipes for everything from everyday breakfasts, lunches and dinners, to scrumptious - and yes, still wholesome! - cakes and sweet treats, to special occasion splurges. David and Stephen also tell their story (how they transformed from jocks to hippies before finally finding their groove), share their top tips for maximizing taste and goodness in food, and explain how they've succeeded in building a food business based on flavour, health and community.",

Obediently, we fall in love amid showers of passionate fireworks, bond for a time \u2026 and then often get fed up with each other and grow irritable or numb. Perhaps we try to remodel our mate, seek solace online, or pursue a new love interest. Ancient sages recognized this biological snare and hinted at a way to dodge it: use lovemaking to balance one another and harmony arises naturally.\u200dWith an entertaining blend of personal experiences, the latest neuroscience, and forgotten insights from around the globe, Cupid\u2019s Poisoned Arrow confronts current assumptions about sex and love and offers a refreshing, practical approach to sexuality.",

            "description": "In 1882 Jigoro Kano (1860-1938) founded Kodokan Judo at Eishoji Temple in Tokyo. It was the culmination of a lifelong devotion to the jujutsu of the past, which he reorganized while taking great care to retain its classical traditions. Historically, martial arts were practiced only by the elite in Japan. Kano, a renowned educator as well as a sportsman, is credited with popularizing the martial arts, and in particular, judo, among people in all levels of society.When he was young, Kano studied jujutsu, a martial art practiced in Japan since feudal times, which involved throwing, hitting, kicking, stabbing, slashing, choking, bending and twisting limbs \u2014 and defenses against these attacks. After years of studying, he realized that although many different jujutsu techniques were taught, there was no one core value holding them together. Kano identified an all-pervasive principle \u2014 to make the most efficient use of mental and physical energy \u2014 and combined only those techniques in which this principle was correctly applied into modern judo. \"Ju\" means gentleness or giving way. \"Do\" means principle or the way. Judo, therefore is the Way of Gentleness, which implies that first giving way leads to ultimate victory. The Kodokan is literally, \"the school for studying the Way.\" This book is a collection of Kano\u2019s essential teachings, selected and compiled from his wealth of writings and lectures spanning a period of fifty-one years. Today the International Judo Federation has 187 member countries and regions. As an official sport of the Olympic Games, judo has inspired young people of all nationalities, and Kodokan is universally recognized as the Mecca of Judo.",

If you are low carb, paleo, are wanting to keep autoimmune issues at bay, or just want to lose extra weight, Eat Happy gives you comfort food where you won\u2019t miss the sugars or grains so your body and brain can feel happy from eating real foodsIn 2012, after almost ten years of being gluten free due to celiac, Anna Vocino found she was gaining weight faster than a tick on a labradoodle. Turns out the culprit wasn\u2019t overeating or too much fat in the diet, but the pesky sugars and grains in all those gluten free comfort foods. When Anna started podcasting with Fitness Confidential author Vinnie Tortorich, she adapted her entire way of eating to do what Tortorich coined: NSNG\u2014No Sugars No Grains. Sure enough, the weight dropped off, the inflammation due to celiac finally calmed down, and for the first time in her life, she learned what it meant to be truly happy about food.All of Anna\u2019s recipes are delicious, easy to make, and so satisfying, you won\u2019t even know you\u2019re eating healthy. Craving rich, decadent chocolate pots with fresh cream that are delicious but not fattening? Wanna make a grain-free pizza crust that actually helps you lose weight? Dying for pancakes, but you\u2019ve committed to avoiding carbs? How about hearty shepherd\u2019s pie, tater tots, sizzling ginger rice, all made with cauliflower instead of high carb rice and potatoes? Eat Happy offers low carb comfort foods to please the entire family.",

            "description": "A fascinating account of vaccination's miraculous, inflammatory past and its uncertain future.In 1796, as smallpox ravaged Europe, Edward Jenner injected a child with a benign version of the disease, then exposed the child to the deadly virus itself. The boy proved resistant to smallpox, and Jenner's risky experiment produced the earliest vaccination. In this deftly written account, journalist Arthur Allen reveals a history of vaccination that is both illuminated with hope and shrouded by controversy\u2014from Jenner's discovery to Pasteur's vaccines for rabies and cholera, to those that safeguarded the children of the twentieth century, and finally to the tumult currently surrounding vaccination.Faced with threats from anthrax to AIDS, we are a vulnerable population and can no longer depend on vaccines; numerous studies have linked childhood vaccination with various neurological disorders, and our pharmaceutical companies are more attracted to the profits of treatment than to the prevention of disease. With narrative grace and investigative journalism, Allen explores our shifting understanding of vaccination since its creation. 16 pages of illustrations.",

But when the myth you've been asked to believe fails to deliver--when you sense you've been settling for far less than you know in your heart is possible--then how do you attract and keep a man capable of meeting what you most passionately yearn for?In Dear Lover, David Deida explores every aspect of the feminine practice of spiritual intimacy, from sexuality and lovemaking, to family and career, to emotions, trust, and commitment. Written as a collection of letters from a man to his dear lover, here is this internationally acclaimed writer's invitation to practice love as a living art, as you discover how to pick the man of deep integrity who will satisfy the needs of your body, heart, and spirit.",

Acclaimed essayist Kerry Howley follows these men for three years through the bloody world of mixed martial arts as they starve themselves, break bones, fail their families and form new ones in the quest to rise from remote Midwestern fairgrounds to packed Vegas arenas. With penetrating intelligence and wry humor, Howley exposes the profundities and absurdities of this American subculture.Kerry Howley's work has appeared in The Paris Review, New York Times Magazine, the Atlantic, Wall Street Journal, Slate, and frequently in Bookforum. She holds an MFA from the University of Iowa's Nonfiction Writing Program.",

            "description": "In the tradition of the best investigative journalism, physician and reporter Sheri Fink reconstructs 5 days at Memorial Medical Center and draws the reader into the lives of those who struggled mightily to survive and to maintain life amid chaos.After Katrina struck and the floodwaters rose, the power failed, and the heat climbed, exhausted caregivers chose to designate certain patients last for rescue. Months later, several health professionals faced criminal allegations that they deliberately injected numerous patients with drugs to hasten their deaths.\u200dFive Days at Memorial, the culmination of six years of reporting, unspools the mystery of what happened in those days, bringing the reader into a hospital fighting for its life and into a conversation about the most terrifying form of health care rationing.In a voice at once involving and fair, masterful and intimate, Fink exposes the hidden dilemmas of end-of-life care and reveals just how ill-prepared we are in America for the impact of large-scale disasters\u2014and how we can do better. A remarkable book, engrossing from start to finish, Five Days at Memorial radically transforms your understanding of human nature in crisis.",

            "description": "The authoritative narrative of CrossFit's beginnings, rapid grassroots growth, and emergence as a worldwide phenomenon.Learning to Breathe Fire is one of the most insightful novels ever written on a sports subculture, combining vivid sports writing with a deep meditation on what it means to be human. J.C. Herz, a seasoned journalist, discusses the science of maximal effort, why the contemporary gym fails a fat population, and the psychological benefits of ending up on the floor feeling like you're going to die in this book.From a solitary underground gym in Santa Cruz to adoption as the exercise of choice for elite special forces, firefighters, and cops, to its popularity as the go-to fitness regimen for everyday Joes and Janes, the tale follows CrossFit's growth. Herz's depiction of The CrossFit Games, which began as an unofficial competition on a California ranch and evolved into a televised global proving ground for the world's fittest men and women, as well as hundreds of thousands of lesser mortals, is particularly compelling.Herz brilliantly portrays the distinctiveness of a fitness culture that cultivates primordial fierceness in normal people in her portrayal of the sport's great players, impassioned trainers, and \"chief armourer,\" Rogue Fitness. And, via the shared experience of an all-consuming workout, she unearths the ritual intensity that has been with us since humans started sports, demonstrating how, at our core, we're all tribal hunters and first responders, waiting for the signal to go all-out.",

            "description": "On a trip to Turkey as a young woman, chef Ana Sortun fell in love with the food and learned the traditions of Turkish cooking from local women. Inspired beyond measure, Sortun opened her own restaurant in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the award-winning Oleana, where she creates her own interpretations of dishes incorporating the incredible array of delicious spices and herbs used in eastern regions of the Mediterranean.In this gorgeously photographed book, Sortun shows readers how to use this philosophy of spice to create wonderful dishes in their own homes. She reveals how the artful use of spices and herbs rather than fat and cream is key to the full, rich flavors of Mediterranean cuisine -- and the way it leaves you feeling satisfied afterward. The book is organized by spice, detailing the ways certain spices complement one another and how they flavor other foods and creating in home cooks a kind of sense-memory that allows for a more intuitive use of spice in their own dishes.",

            "description": "It\u2019s the herbicide on our dinner plates, a chemical so pervasive it\u2019s in the air we breathe, our water, our soil, and even found increasingly in our own bodies. Known as Monsanto\u2019s Roundup by consumers, and as glyphosate by scientists, the world\u2019s most popular weed killer is used everywhere from backyard gardens to golf courses to millions of acres of farmland. For decades it\u2019s been touted as safe enough to drink, but a growing body of evidence indicates just the opposite, with research tying the chemical to cancers and a host of other health threats.In Whitewash, veteran journalist Carey Gillam uncovers one of the most controversial stories in the history of food and agriculture, exposing new evidence of corporate influence. Gillam introduces readers to farm families devastated by cancers which they believe are caused by the chemical, and to scientists whose reputations have been smeared for publishing research that contradicted business interests. Readers learn about the arm-twisting of regulators who signed off on the chemical, echoing company assurances of safety even as they permitted higher residues of the herbicide in food and skipped compliance tests. And, in startling detail, Gillam reveals secret industry communications that pull back the curtain on corporate efforts to manipulate public perception.Whitewash is more than an expos\u00e9 about the hazards of one chemical or even the influence of one company. It\u2019s a story of power, politics, and the deadly consequences of putting corporate interests ahead of public safety.",

Miller and journalist and caregiver Shoshana Berger write in A Beginner\u2019s Guide to the End. \u201cOur ultimate purpose here isn\u2019t so much to help you die as it is to free up as much life as possible until you do.\u201dTheirs is a clear-eyed and big-hearted action plan for approaching the end of life, written to help readers feel more in control of an experience that so often seems anything but controllable. Their book offers everything from step-by-step instructions for how to do your paperwork and navigate the healthcare system to answers to questions you might be afraid to ask your doctor, like whether or not sex is still okay when you\u2019re sick. Get advice for how to break the news to your employer, whether to share old secrets with your family, how to face friends who might not be as empathetic as you\u2019d hoped, and how to talk to your children about your will. (Don\u2019t worry: if anyone gets snippy, it\u2019ll likely be their spouses, not them.) There are also lessons for survivors, like how to shut down a loved one\u2019s social media accounts, clean out the house, and write a great eulogy.An honest, surprising, and detail-oriented guide to the most universal of all experiences, A Beginner\u2019s Guide to the End is \u201ca book that every family should have, the equivalent of Dr. Spock but for this other phase of life\u201d (New York Times bestselling author Dr. Abraham Verghese).",

            "description": "\"Elaborating on the science as well as the business behind the fight against cystic fibrosis, Trivedi captures the emotions of the families, doctors, and scientists involved in the clinical trials and their 'weeping with joy' as new drugs are approved, and shows how cystic fibrosis, once a 'death sentence,' became, for many, a manageable condition. This is a rewarding and challenging work.\"\u2014Publishers WeeklyCystic fibrosis was once a mysterious disease that killed infants and children. Now it could be the key to healing millions with genetic diseases of every type\u2014from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's to diabetes and sickle cell anemia.In 1974, Joey O'Donnell was born with strange symptoms. His insatiable appetite, incessant vomiting, and a relentless cough\u2014which shook his tiny, fragile body and made it difficult to draw breath\u2014confounded doctors and caused his parents agonizing, sleepless nights. After six sickly months, his salty skin provided the critical clue: he was one of thousands of Americans with cystic fibrosis, an inherited lung disorder that would most likely kill him before his first birthday.The gene and mutation responsible for CF were found in 1989\u2014discoveries that promised to lead to a cure for kids like Joey. But treatments unexpectedly failed and CF was deemed incurable. It was only after the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, a grassroots organization founded by parents, formed an unprecedented partnership with a fledgling biotech company that transformative leaps in drug development were harnessed to produce groundbreaking new treatments: pills that could fix the crippled protein at the root of this deadly disease.From science writer Bijal P. Trivedi, Breath from Salt chronicles the riveting saga of cystic fibrosis, from its ancient origins to its identification in the dank autopsy room of a hospital basement, and from the CF gene's celebrated status as one of the first human disease genes ever discovered to the groundbreaking targeted genetic therapies that now promise to cure it.Told from the perspectives of the patients, families, physicians, scientists, and philanthropists fighting on the front lines, Breath from Salt is a remarkable story of unlikely scientific and medical firsts, of setbacks and successes, and of people who refused to give up hope\u2014and a fascinating peek into the future of genetics and medicine.",

            "description": "\"A deeply affecting work from one of the important and innovative voices in American health and medicine.\" -- Arianna HuffingtonIn Well, physician Sandro Galea examines what Americans miss when they fixate on healthcare: health.Americans spend more money on health than people anywhere else in the world. And what do they get for it? Statistically, not much. Americans today live shorter, less healthy lives than citizens of other rich countries, and these trends show no signs of letting up.The problem, Sandro Galea argues, is that Americans focus on the wrong things when they think about health. Our national understanding of what constitutes \"being well\" is centered on medicine -- the lifestyles we adopt to stay healthy, and the insurance plans and prescriptions we fall back on when we're not. While all these things are important, they've not proven to be the difference between healthy and unhealthy on the large scale.\u200dWell is a radical examination of the subtle and not-so-subtle factors that determine who gets to be healthy in America. Galea shows how the country's failing health is a product of American history and character -- and how refocusing on our national health can usher enlightenment across American life and politics.",

            "description": "Beloved teacher and bestselling cookbook author Marcella Hazan tells how a young girl raised in Emilia-Romagna became America's godmother of Italian cooking.Widely credited with introducing proper Italian food to the English-speaking world, Marcella Hazan is as authentic as they come. Raised in Cesenatico, a quiet fishing town on the northern Adriatic Sea, she?s eventually have her own cooking schools in New York, Bologna, and Venice and teach students from around the world to appreciate and produce the food that native Italians eat. She?d write bestselling and award-winning cookbooks, collect invitations to cook at top restaurants, and have thousands of loyal students and readers.When Marcella met the love of her life, Victor, they married and moved to New York City. She knew not a word of English or what's more surprising a single recipe. She longed for the flavors of her homeland and attempted to re-create them. One day Craig Claiborne invited himself to lunch, and the rest is history.Amarcord means I remember in Marcella's native Romagnolo dialect. In these pages, Marcella looks back on the adventures of a life lived for pleasure and a love of teaching. Throughout, she entertains the reader with stories of the twists and turns that brought her love, fame and a chance to change the way we eat forever.",

            "description": "In Cooked, Michael Pollan explores the previously uncharted territory of his own kitchen. Here, he discovers the enduring power of the four classical elements\u2014fire, water, air, and earth\u2014to transform the stuff of nature into delicious things to eat and drink. Apprenticing himself to a succession of culinary masters, Pollan learns how to grill with fire, cook with liquid, bake bread, and ferment everything from cheese to beer.Each section of Cooked tracks Pollan\u2019s effort to master a single classic recipe using one of the four elements. A North Carolina barbecue pit master tutors him in the primal magic of fire; a Chez Panisse\u2013trained cook schools him in the art of braising; a celebrated baker teaches him how air transforms grain and water into a fragrant loaf of bread; and finally, several mad-genius \u201cfermentos\u201d (a tribe that includes brewers, cheese makers, and all kinds of picklers) reveal how fungi and bacteria can perform the most amazing alchemies of all. The reader learns alongside Pollan, but the lessons move beyond the practical to become an investigation of how cooking involves us in a web of social and ecological relationships. Cooking, above all, connects us.The effects of not cooking are similarly far reaching. Relying upon corporations to process our food means we consume large quantities of fat, sugar, and salt; disrupt an essential link to the natural world; and weaken our relationships with family and friends. In fact, Cooked argues, taking back control of cooking may be the single most important step anyone can take to help make the American food system healthier and more sustainable. Reclaiming cooking as an act of enjoyment and self-reliance, learning to perform the magic of these everyday transformations, opens the door to a more nourishing life.",

            "description": "For more than 3,000 years, the relentless, incurable illness known as smallpox has killed, maimed, or blinded hundreds of millions of people. Dr. D.A. Henderson became the director of a global drive to wipe this illness off the face of the earth in 1967.Dr. Henderson's personal account of leading the World Health Organization's drive to eradicate smallpox\u2014the first disease in history to be purposefully eradicated\u2014is told in this enthralling book. This effort has been dubbed \"the greatest scientific and humanitarian achievement of the century\" by some.Dr. Henderson makes it apparent that the massive worldwide effort entailed more than just mass immunization in a vivid, fascinating tale. Civil wars, floods, impassable roads, and refugees were among the challenges he and his team faced, as well as strong bureaucratic and cultural impediments, a scarcity of local health experts, and tight resources. Countries from all over the globe contributed to the endeavor; the US and the Soviet Union collaborated during the darkest days of the Cold War; and WHO field employees came from more than 70 countries. The final incidence of smallpox occurred on October 26, 1976. The illness that had killed two million or more people every year had been eradicated\u2013in little over 10 years.That was not the end of the story. Dr. Henderson describes in great detail the ongoing debate over whether or not to kill the residual virus in the two laboratories where it was still being housed. Then came the shocking revelation that the Soviet Union had been testing and generating smallpox virus as a biological weapon in enormous quantities. The possibility of it being used by a rogue nation or a terrorist had to be addressed seriously, and Dr. Henderson was a key role in devising strategies to deal with it.He wanted to expand the smallpox immunization program to include polio, measles, whooping cough, diphtheria, and tetanus vaccinations since new methods for mass smallpox vaccination were so successful. Poliomyelitis is now eradicated in more than four out of five children throughout the world because to this initiative.This one-of-a-kind book is a personal and genuine narrative that demonstrates how even the most difficult barriers can be conquered with collaboration and determination.",

            "description": "Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking is a kitchen classic. Hailed by Time magazine as \"a minor masterpiece\" when it first appeared in 1984, On Food and Cooking is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they're made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious. Now, for its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee has prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment.\u200dOn Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped give birth to the inventive culinary movement known as \"molecular gastronomy.\" Though other books have now been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques.",

            "description": "From an obesity and neuroscience researcher with a knack for engaging, humorous storytelling, The Hungry Brain uses cutting-edge science to answer the questions: why do we overeat, and what can we do about it?No one wants to overeat. And certainly no one wants to overeat for years, become overweight, and end up with a high risk of diabetes or heart disease--yet two thirds of Americans do precisely that. Even though we know better, we often eat too much. Why does our behavior betray our own intentions to be lean and healthy? The problem, argues obesity and neuroscience researcher Stephan J. Guyenet, is not necessarily a lack of willpower or an incorrect understanding of what to eat. Rather, our appetites and food choices are led astray by ancient, instinctive brain circuits that play by the rules of a survival game that no longer exists. And these circuits don\u2019t care about how you look in a bathing suit next summer.To make the case, The Hungry Brain takes readers on an eye-opening journey through cutting-edge neuroscience that has never before been available to a general audience. The Hungry Brain delivers profound insights into why the brain undermines our weight goals and transforms these insights into practical guidelines for eating well and staying slim. Along the way, it explores how the human brain works, revealing how this mysterious organ makes us who we are.",

            "description": "In 1999, after a series of wildly adventurous jobs around the world, Sam Sheridan found himself in Australia, loaded with cash and intent on not working until he\u2019d spent it all. It occurred to him that, without distractions, he could finally indulge a long-dormant obsession: fighting. Within a year, he was in Bangkok training with the greatest fighter in muay Thai (Thai kickboxing) history and stepping through the ropes for a professional bout. That one fight wasn\u2019t enough. Sheridan set out to test himself on an epic journey into how and why we fight, facing Olympic boxers, Brazilian jiu-jitsu stars, and Ultimate Fighting champions. Along the way, Sheridan delivers an insightful look at violence as a career and a spectator sport, a behind-the-pageantry glimpse of athletes at the top of their terrifying game. \u00a0An extraordinary combination of gonzo journalism and participatory sports writing, A Fighter\u2019s Heart is a dizzying first-hand account of what it\u2019s like to reach the peak of finely disciplined personal aggression, to hit\u2014and be hit.",

            "description": "M.F.K. Fisher, whom John Updike has called our \"poet of the appetites,\" here pays tribute to that most delicate and enigmatic of foods---the oyster. As she tells of oysters found in stews, in soups, roasted, baked, fried, prepared \u00e0 la Rockefeller or au naturel--and of the pearls sometimes found therein--Fisher describes her mother's joy at encountering oyster loaf in a girls' dorm in he 1890's, recalls her own initiation into the \"strange cold succulence\" of raw oysters as a young woman in Marseille and Dijon, and explores both the bivalve's famed aphrodisiac properties and its equally notorious gut-wrenching powers. Plumbing the \"dreadful but exciting\" life of the oyster, Fisher invites readers to share in the comforts and delights that this delicate edible evokes, and enchants us along the way with her characteristically wise and witty prose.",

The Ali-Frazier matchup had become a madness, inflamed by the media and the politics of race. When the \"Thrilla in Manila\" was over, one man was left with a ruin of a life; the other was battered to his soul.Mark Kram covered that fight for Sports Illustrated in an award-winning article. Now his riveting book reappraises the boxers -- who they are and who they were. And in a voice as powerful as a heavyweight punch, Kram explodes the myths surrounding each fighter, particularly Ali. A controversial, no-holds-barred account, Ghosts of Manila ranks with the finest boxing books ever written.",

Sleep quality has been shown to be the single most important factor in predicting longevity, outperforming diet, exercise, and heredity. Despite this, we are a sleep-deprived society, oblivious to the truths of sleep\u2014and the cost of sleep deprivation. Dr. William Dement, founder and director of the Stanford University Sleep Research Center, explains what happens when we sleep, what happens when we don't, and how we can reclaim the most powerful\u2014and underappreciated\u2014health miracle of all in this groundbreaking book based on decades of research on the frontiers of sleep science.Dr. Dement takes us on a fascinating tour of our sleeping body and mind, revealing the cost of disregarding sleep: an epidemic of heart disease, 33% of traffic-fatigue-related accidents, and incalculable mental and psychological consequences. And he provides a hands-on prescription for vibrant good health and longevity, which includes...self-tests to determine how much sleep you really need...the role of prescription and over-the-counter sleeping aids...the latest research on how sleep affects the immune system...how to combat insomnia, snoring, and jet lag...plus information on sleep disorder clinics nationwide.",

Simmons first adopted a vegetarian and then vegan diet, and almost immediately began to experience the physical, mental, and emotional benefits of eating green and clean. He delves into research about mindful eating, the links between stress and poor eating habits, the importance of listening to your body, the well-documented problems associated with eating animal products and processed foods, along with tips on how to transition to a vegan diet.Drawing on his own experience, the experiences of others, and science and research on the health benefits of conscious eating and veganism, The Happy Vegan is an accessible and inspiring guide to help others make the move toward a vegan diet and a more successful, focused, and purposeful life",

            "description": "Bestselling author, longevity expert, and National Geographic Explorer Dan Buettner reports on health, fitness, diet, and aging, drawing on his research from extraordinarily long-lived communities--Blue Zones--around the globe. Buettner has launched a major public health initiative to transform cities based on principles from this book, an updated and expanded edition of his bestselling classic on longevity. His prescriptions for lifestyle, nutrition, outlook, and stress-coping practices will add years to your life and life to your years.The latest Blue Zone is Ikaria, Greece, where strong, sweet wine, family, and a Mediterranean diet all play a role in longer life. Also new in this book is a reading group guide, designed for groups to read about, discuss, and implement many of the simple changes advocated for better health.A long, healthy life is no accident. It begins with good genes, but it also depends on good habits. If you adopt the right lifestyle, experts say, chances are you may live up to a decade longer. Buettner has led teams of researchers across the globe--from Costa Rica to Sardinia, Italy, to Okinawa, Japan and beyond--to uncover the secrets of Blue Zones. He found that the recipe for longevity is deeply intertwined with community, lifestyle, and spirituality. People live longer and healthier by embracing a few simple but powerful habits, and by creating the right community around themselves. In The Blue Zones, Second Edition, Buettner has blended his lifestyle formula with the latest longevity research to inspire lasting, behavioral change and add years to your life.Region by region, Buettner reveals the \"secrets\" of longevity through stories of his travels and interviews with some of the most remarkable--and happily long-living people on the planet. It's not coincidence that the way they eat, interact with each other, shed stress, heal themselves, avoid disease, and view their world yield them more good years of life.",

Jeter. Ali. Williams. These elite legends have changed the game, achieved the unthinkable, and pushed their bodies to unbelievable limits. Joining their exclusive ranks is Tom Brady.\u201cBrady is the healthiest great champion the NFL has ever had, both physically and mentally\u201d (Sally Jenkins, The Washington Post). The longtime New England Patriots quarterback, who in 2017 achieved his fifth Super Bowl win and fourth Super Bowl MVP award, is widely regarded as an athlete whose training and determination pushed him from a mediocre draft position to the most-revered and respected professional football player of his generation.In The TB12 Method, Tom Brady explains how he developed his groundbreaking approach to long-term fitness, presenting a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to his personal practice. Brady offers the principles behind pliability, which is at the heart of a new paradigm shift and movement toward a more natural, healthier way of exercising, training, and living\u2014and one that challenges some commonly held assumptions around health and wellness. Filled with lessons learned from Brady\u2019s own peak performance training, and step-by-step action steps to help readers develop and maintain their own peak performance, The TB12 Method also advocates for more effective approaches to strength training, hydration, nutrition, supplementation, cognitive fitness, recovery, and other lifestyle choices that dramatically decrease the risk of injury while amplifying and extending performance, as well as quality of life.After using his methods for over a decade, Brady believes that the TB12 approach has made him\u2014and can make any athlete, male or female, in any sport and at any level\u2014achieve their own peak performance. With instructions, drills, photos, in-depth case studies that Brady himself has used, as well as personal anecdotes and experiences from on and off the field, The TB12 Method is the only book an athlete will ever need, a playbook from Brady himself that will change the game.",

Plus, the healthy food world can be as tempting as getting your bikini line cleaned with a high-pressure hose. It may be annoying, preachy, and full of fads due to its overzealousness.But good eating isn't only for health nuts and upper-crust people; it's for everyone. Shannon Kelly White, an Australian nurse and mother, started Shannon's Kitchen to offer her tasty, doable recipes (along with an inappropriate amount of penis jokes and references to nipple erections).Shannon introduces 60 easy-to-follow recipes for healthy food in Shannon's Kitchen: Healthy Food You'll Actually F**king Eat! to help you live a bloody happy and enjoyable life. This book is for you if you've had enough of diets, detoxes, and ideal clean eating types - no preaching crap or etiquette, just good cuisine, incorrect language, and no f**ks given.",

            "description": "Michael Jordan and countless other NBA stars credit George Mumford with transforming their game. A widely respected public speaker and coach, Mumford shares his story and strategies in The Mindful Athlete. His proven techniques transform the performance of anyone with a goal, be they an Olympian, weekend warrior, executive, hacker, or artist.A basketball player at the University of Massachusetts (where he roomed with Dr. J, Julius Erving), injuries forced Mumford out of the game he loved. The meds that relieved the pain of his injuries also numbed him to the emptiness he felt without the game and eventually led him to heroin. After years as a functioning addict, Mumford made meditation the center of his life. He kicked drugs, earned a master\u2019s degree, and began teaching meditation to inmates and others.Mumford went on to partner with coach Phil Jackson, a long-time mindfulness practitioner, working with him and each of the teams he coached to become NBA champions. His roster of champion clients now includes executives and Olympians. With a charismatic style that combines mindfulness with lessons from icons like Yoda and Bruce Lee, Mumford delivers an engrossing story and an invaluable resource.",

            "description": "Used as a reference by students of acupuncture, this is a hefty, truly comprehensive guide to the theory and healing power of Chinese medicine. It's also a primer on nutrition--including facts about green foods, such as spirulina and blue-green algae, and the \"regeneration diets\" used by cancer patients and arthritics--along with an inspiring cookbook with more than 300 mostly vegetarian, nutrient-packed recipes.The information on Chinese medicine is useful for helping to diagnose health imbalances, especially nascent illnesses. It's smartly paired with the whole-foods program because the Chinese have attributed various health-balancing properties to foods, so you can tailor your diet to help alleviate symptoms of illness. For example, Chinese medicine dictates that someone with low energy and a pale complexion (a yin deficiency) would benefit from avoiding bitter foods and increasing \"sweet\" foods such as soy, black sesame seeds, parsnips, rice, and oats. (Note that the Chinese definition of sweet foods is much different from the American one!)Pitchford says in his dedication that he hopes the reader finds \"healing, awareness, and peace\" from following his program. The diet is certainly acetic by American standards (no alcohol, caffeine, white flour, fried foods, or sugar, and a minimum of eggs and dairy) but the reasons he gives for avoiding these \"negative energy\" foods are compelling. From the adrenal damage imparted by coffee to immune dysfunction brought on by excess refined sugar, Pitchford spurs you to rethink every dietary choice and its ultimate influence on your health. Without being alarmist, he adds dietary tips for protecting yourself against the dangers of modern life, including neutralizing damage from water fluoridation (thyroid and immune-system problems may result; fluoride is a carcinogen). There's further reading on food combining, female health, heart disease, pregnancy, fasting, and weight loss. Overall, this is a wonderful book for anyone who's serious about strengthening his or her body from the inside out.",

            "description": "Golfing great Bobby Jones said, \"Competition is won or lost on the six-inch playing field between the ears.\" How do the best athletes gain an advantage on that playing field? In Mind Gym, noted sports psychology consultant Gary Mack teaches athletes the lessons he's learned about how the mind influences athletic performance as much as physical skill does, if not more so. Through forty accessible lessons and inspirational anecdotes from prominent athletes--many of whom he has worked with--Mack shares the same techniques and exercises he uses to help elite athletes build mental \"muscle.\" Achieving this inner excellence requires time and effort.The more you work on the inside, the more it shows on the outside. These engaging stories--covering such themes as overcoming adversity, staying motivated, and following one's dreams--will enable you to perform at your best by choice rather than chance. Mind Gym will give anyone who spires to be a better athlete the \"head edge\" over the competition.",

Basketball (and Other Things) introduces readers to a whole new set of crucial and ludicrous fan feuds from basketball history, offering arguments and solutions illustrated with Shea Serrano's trademark humor and insight. Serrano deconstructs disputes that NBA fans didn't realize they needed, from the traditional (How many years was Kobe Bryant the best player in the league throughout his career?) to the fanciful (If you could give various values to different shots in basketball history, what would they be and why?) This book is a must-have for everyone who has ever sat up late debating basketball's greatest events, what-ifs, myths, and legends, or for those who are discovering the mythology of basketball for the first time. It has fantastic art by Arturo Torres.",

            "description": "From Bulletproof creator and bestselling author Dave Asprey comes a revolutionary approach to anti-aging that will help you up your game at any age.Dave Asprey suffered countless symptoms of aging as a young man, which sparked a life-long burning desire to grow younger with each birthday. For more than twenty years, he has been on a quest to find innovative, science-backed methods to upgrade human biology and redefine the limits of the mind, body, and spirit. The results speak for themselves. Now in his forties, Dave is smarter, happier, and more fit and successful than ever before.In Super Human, he shows how this is level of health and performance possible for all of us. While we assume we will peak in middle age and then decline, Asprey\u2019s research reveals there is another way. It is possible to make changes on the sub-cellular level to dramatically extend life span. And the tools to live longer also give you more energy and brainpower right now.The answers lie in Dave\u2019s Seven Pillars of Aging that contribute to degeneration and disease while diminishing your performance in the moment. Using simple interventions\u2014like diet, sleep, light, exercise, and little-known but powerful hacks from ozone therapy to proper jaw alignment, you can decelerate cellular aging and supercharge your body\u2019s ability to heal and rejuvenate.\u2028A self-proclaimed human guinea pig, Asprey arms readers with practical advice to maximize their lives at every age with his signature mix of science-geek wonder, candor, and enthusiasm. Getting older no longer has to mean decline. Now it\u2019s an opportunity to become Super Human.",

            "description": "The most gifted athlete ever to play the game, Michael Jordan rose to heights no basketball player had ever reached before. What drove Michael Jordan? The pursuit of team success...or of his own personal glory? The pursuit of excellence...or of his next multimillion-dollar endorsement? The flight of the man they call Air Jordan had been rocked by controversy. In The Jordan Rules, which chronicles the Chicago Bulls' first championship season, Sam Smith takes the #1 Bull by the horns to reveal the team behind the man...and the man behind the Madison Avenue smile. Here is the inside game, both on and off the court, including:Jordan's power struggles with management, from verbal attacks on the general manager to tantrums against his coachBehind-the-scenes feuds, as Jordan punches a teammate in practice and refuses to pass the ball in the crucial minutes of big gamesThe players who competed with His Airness for Air Time -- Scottie Pippen, Horace Grant, Bill Cartwright -- telling their sides of the storyA penetrating look at coach Phil Jackson, the former flower child who blossomed into one of the NBA's top motivators and who finally found a way to coax \"Michael and the Jordanaires\" to the their first titleA provocative eyewitness account, The Jordan Rules delivers all the non stop excitement, tension, and thrills of a championship season -- and an intense, fascinating portrait of the incomparable Michael Jordan.",

            "description": "Cultured Food for Life is a part of a new genre of cookbooks gaining popularity among a growing demographic of health and wellness aficionados. In this work, fermentation guru Donna Schwenk introduces readers to the healing properties of kefir, kombucha, cultured vegetables, sprouted flour, and sourdough. Fermentation has been used in food preparation for thousands of years, but in the past few decades it has moved from being a commonplace kitchen ritual to being something done only by a few health-conscious proponents. Most fermentation now is done at factories, whose processes strip away some of the abundant vitamins, minerals, and healthy bacteria that make this way of preparing foods so beneficial. But Donna Schwenk is working to bring this staple of food preparation back to readers by showing that these now-unfamiliar processes are actually easy and fun. And by doing this, she opens the door to a world of foods that can help rid readers of health problems including high blood pressure, diabetes, allergies, acne, hypertension, asthma, and irritable bowel syndrome.After telling the astonishing story of how she healed herself and her family with these probiotic foods, Schwenk walks readers, step by step, through the basic preparation techniques for kefir, kombucha, cultured vegetables, sprouted flour, and sourdough plus more than 120 recipes that use these foods to create dishes to please any palate. With recipes like Herbed Omelet with Kefir Hollandaise Sauce, Sprouted Ginger Scones with Peaches and Kefir Cream, Kefir Veggie Sprouted Pizza, Apple Sauerkraut, and Sprouted Brownies Kefir Cupcakes, along with inspirational stories from Donna\u2019s family and friends, readers will enjoy a diet that\u2019s as delicious as it is healthy. Schwenk originally self-published a portion of this book through Balboa Press. It garnered solid sales and positive reviews.",

Nate Green is one of them.Built for Show is the first fitness book geared specifically for young men on the hunt. It's not only written for them; one of them wrote it. Green, who is only 23, is a seasoned fitness professional who has been featured in Men's Health and Maximum Fitness publications. Green has four 12-week training plans to choose from, each with a different seasonal theme. Fall and winter workouts increase muscle growth and strength, which may be seen through layers of clothes. The spring and summer routines help you lose weight and chisel your show-stopping muscles, giving you a sleek, beach-ready figure.Built for Show, on the other hand, is more than just a fitness book. It also includes:\u00a0-Realistic dietary recommendations on how to feed muscles while starving fat without breaking the budget or spending hours in the kitchen.-Dress appropriately, look the part, improve your social position, and adjust to your new lifestyle with these tips.-No matter the scenario, there are quick techniques to measure posture and effective exercises to address problems and enhance self-presentation.Over fifty exercises are included in the thorough plans, which are accompanied by over a hundred unique photographs.Built for Show is neither a weight-loss nor a body-building textbook; instead, it exposes to men just what they need to achieve the physique they \u2013 and women \u2013 desire.",

            "description": "This extraordinary cookbook, Classic Indian Cooking, amounts to a complete course in Indian cuisine. Elucidated by over 100 line drawings, it systematically introduces the properties of all the basic spices and special ingredients of Indian food, then explains the techniques employed in using them, always with the help of comparisons to familiar Western methods.It is immediately obvious that Indian food is rich and varied, yet not difficult to prepare. The cooking principles are basic and wellknown. The utensils needed are few and simple. As Julie Sahni says, \"If you know how to fry, there are few tricks to Indian food.\" Every recipe has been especially designed for the American kitchen -- practically all the ingredients can be found in any American supermarket and there are scores of time-saving shortcuts with the food processor and handy directions for ahead-of-time preparation.Following a lively and absorbing introduction to the history of India's classic Moghul cuisine, Julie guides the cook through the individual components that make up an Indian meal. She begins with delicious appetizers like Crab Malabar and Hyderabad lime soup; continues through main courses, both nonvegetarian and vegetarian (this book is a treasure trove for the non-meat eater); goes on to all the side dishes and traditional accompaniments, from spinach raita and lentils with garlic butter to saffron pilaf and whole wheat flaky bread; and ends with the glorious desserts, like Ras Malai, sweetmeats, and beverages. Clear, illustrated, step-by-step instructions accompany the cook through every stage, even for making the many wondrous Indian breads, both by hand and with the food processor. And at the end of each recipe are balanced serving suggestions for every kind of meal, Among the many special features are ideas for appropriate wines, a useful spice chart, a complete glossary (which might also come in handy when ordering in Indian restaurants), and a mailorder shopping guide that will make Indian spices accessible anywhere.Most important, Julie Sahni imparts the secrets to mastering the art of Indian cooking. Even the beginner will quickly learn to move within the classic tradition and improvise with sureness and ease.Julie Sahni has written a masterpiece of culinary instruction, as readable as it is usable, a joy to cook from, a fascination to read.",

            "description": "A long-awaited photographic memoir from Miami Heat basketball sensation Dwyane Wade, featuring over 100 brand-new pictures from Wade's life on and off the court.Dwyane Wade has amazed basketball fans with his on-court creativity for more than 15 years and has created his personal brand into one of the most powerful in sports. Wade takes readers inside his intriguing life and work in this magnificent 4-color book, which includes more than 100 never-before-seen images from Bob Metelus, who has been documenting Wade's career for more than a decade.Wade's difficult upbringing on Chicago's South Side, his college career at Marquette, where he went from unheralded recruit to one of college basketball's greatest stars, and his extraordinary years with the Miami Heat, with whom he won three NBA championships and was named an All-Star 13 times, are all depicted in three dimensions. The book focuses on Wade's core values, which have guided him throughout his career: being a great teammate and leader. While skill may make you a celebrity, Wade explains that being a champion requires sacrifice: putting the team's aims ahead of your own ego. Wade has lived this philosophy throughout his career, from his days with Shaq (with whom he won his first title), through the \"Big 3\" with LeBron and Bosh, to his final season as a player, when he coached the Heat's bright but youthful lineup. These same ideals have impacted his personal life as well, allowing him to be a supportive husband and partner to Gabrielle Union, as well as an exceptional role model for his children.3 Dimensional is a fascinating look into the mind and heart of one of basketball's most charismatic players. It is the definitive inside look at the life and career of one of the sport's biggest players, and it coincides with a documentary chronicling Wade's last NBA season.",

With his characteristic wit, Plimpton recounts his experiences in talking his way into training camp with the Detroit Lions, practicing with the team, and taking snaps behind center. His breezy style captures the pressures and tensions rookies confront, the hijinks that pervade when sixty high-strung guys live together in close quarters, and a host of football rites and rituals.One of the funniest and most insightful books ever written on football, Paper Lion is a classic look at the gridiron game and a book The Wall Street Journal calls \"a continuous feast...The best book ever about football -- or anything!\"",

            "description": "The mental well-being of children and adults is shockingly poor. Marc Brackett, author of Permission to Feel, knows why. And he knows what we can do.Marc Brackett is a professor in Yale University\u2019s Child Study Center and founding director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence. In his 25 years as an emotion scientist, he has developed a remarkably effective plan to improve the lives of children and adults \u2013 a blueprint for understanding our emotions and using them wisely so that they help, rather than hinder, our success and well-being. The core of his approach is a legacy from his childhood, from an astute uncle who gave him permission to feel. He was the first adult who managed to see Marc, listen to him, and recognize the suffering, bullying, and abuse he\u2019d endured. And that was the beginning of Marc\u2019s awareness that what he was going through was temporary. He wasn\u2019t alone, he wasn\u2019t stuck on a timeline, and he wasn\u2019t \u201cwrong\u201d to feel scared, isolated, and angry. Now, best of all, he could do something about it.In the decades since, Marc has led large research teams and raised tens of millions of dollars to investigate the roots of emotional well-being. His prescription for healthy children (and their parents, teachers, and schools) is a system called RULER, a high-impact and fast-effect approach to understanding and mastering emotions that has already transformed the thousands of schools that have adopted it. RULER has been proven to reduce stress and burnout, improve school climate, and enhance academic achievement. This book is the culmination of Marc\u2019s development of RULER and his way to share the strategies and skills with readers around the world. It is tested, and it works.This book combines rigor, science, passion and inspiration in equal parts. Too many children and adults are suffering; they are ashamed of their feelings and emotionally unskilled, but they don\u2019t have to be. Marc Brackett\u2019s life mission is to reverse this course, and this book can show you how.",

            "description": "This book is perhaps the jewel in Prospect\u2019s crown. Within a few months of its first appearance in 1986 it was hailed as a modern classic. Fiona MacCarthy wrote in The Times that, \u2018the book is a large and grandiose life history, a passionate narrative of extremes of experience.\u2019 Jeremy Round called Patience Gray \u2018the high priestess of cooking\u2019, whose book \u2018pushes the form of the cookery book as far as it can go.\u2019 Angela Carter remarked that \u2018it was less a cookery book that a summing-up of the genre of the late-modern British cookery book.\u2019 The work has attracted a cult following in the United States, where passages have been read out at great length on the radio; and it has been anthologized by Paul Levy in The Penguin Book of Food and Drink. It was given a special award by the Andr\u00e9 Simon Book Prize committee in 1987.",

            "description": "Unlike Thomas Szasz, who argues forcefully for the legalization of drugs in Our Right to Drugs (Praeger, 1992), Lenson tackles this subject by meditating on the national consumerist paradigm, the way the war on drugs closed avenues for heterogeneity, the lack of a vocabulary to describe changes in a user's consciousness, the senselessness of talking about \"drugs\" indiscriminately, and the differences among the users, the drugs, and the effects of psychedelics, cannabis, stimulants (cocaine, crack, amphetamines), depressants (heroin), opiates, and alcohol.He contrasts drugs of pleasure to drugs of desire and believes that \"to legislate against drugs of pleasure is like legislating against music, chess, golf....\" Lenson says that nothing in his professional life qualifies him to write about drugs, but his style and his literary and philosophical references would pinpoint him as an academic even if he were not identified as a University of Massachusetts professor of literature, albeit one who surveys his students' usage habits.Lenson's credentials as a user were probably the impetus for this work, but they are not much evident in the text. In the national debate and reevaluation of attitudes toward drugs, this is a different kind of contribution, one that is speculative, discursive, and visionary.",

In this 5000-mile journey through the noodle shops, tempura temples, and teahouses of Japan, Matt Goulding, co-creator of the enormously popular Eat This, Not That! book series, navigates the intersection between food, history, and culture, creating one of the most ambitious and complete books ever written about Japanese culinary culture from the Western perspective.Written in the same evocative voice that drives the award-winning magazine Roads & Kingdoms, Rice, Noodle, Fish explores Japan's most intriguing culinary disciplines in seven key regions, from the kaiseki tradition of Kyoto and the sushi masters of Tokyo to the street food of Osaka and the ramen culture of Fukuoka. You won't find hotel recommendations or bus schedules; you will find a brilliant narrative that interweaves immersive food journalism with intimate portraits of the cities and the people who shape Japan's food culture.This is not your typical guidebook. Rice, Noodle, Fish is a rare blend of inspiration and information, perfect for the intrepid and armchair traveler alike. Combining literary storytelling, indispensable insider information, and world-class design and photography, the end result is the first ever guidebook for the new age of culinary tourism.",

Fisher\u2019s How to Cook a Wolf\u2014 written in 1942 during wartime shortages\u2014An Everlasting Meal shows that cooking is the path to better eating.\u200dThrough the insightful essays in An Everlasting Meal, Tamar Adler issues a rallying cry to home cooks.In chapters about boiling water, cooking eggs and beans, and summoning respectable meals from empty cupboards, Tamar weaves philosophy and instruction into approachable lessons on instinctive cooking. Tamar shows how to make the most of everything you buy, demonstrating what the world\u2019s great chefs know: that great meals rely on the bones and peels and ends of meals before them.She explains how to smarten up simple food and gives advice for fixing dishes gone awry. She recommends turning to neglected onions, celery, and potatoes for inexpensive meals that taste full of fresh vegetables, and cooking meat and fish resourcefully.By wresting cooking from doctrine and doldrums, Tamar encourages readers to begin from wherever they are, with whatever they have. An Everlasting Meal is elegant testimony to the value of cooking and an empowering, indispensable tool for eaters today.",

            "description": "One of the biggest myths in our society is that you can simply choose to be happy whenever you want, even in spite of challenging circumstances. Or, that happiness is a byproduct of making more money, falling in love, or being successful. But modern research says this is an illusion. Happiness is not sustained through achievements. Rather, it is the result of having strong \u201cinner\u201d muscles.The Inner Gym is to inner strength what the outer gym is to physical strength\u2014it is a means for strengthening the inner muscles that are responsible for solidifying true happiness, from the inside out. With brawny inner muscles, you will be able to tap into your happiness, no matter the circumstances. With weak inner muscles, you can have it all and still be unhappy. The stability of your happiness depends on much you work out in The Inner Gym.",

            "description": "Gwyneth Paltrow, Academy-Award winning actress and bestselling cookbook author, returns with recipes for the foods she eats when she wants to lose weight, look good, and feel more energetic.Last spring, after a particularly grueling schedule and lapse of overindulgence, Gwyneth Paltrow was feeling fatigued and faint. A visit to her doctor revealed that she was anemic, vitamin D deficient, and that her stress levels were sky high. He prescribed an elimination diet to clear out her system and help her body heal. But this meant no coffee, no alcohol, no dairy, no eggs, no sugar, no shellfish, no deep-water fish, no wheat, no meat, no soy, nothing processed at all!An avid foodie, Paltrow was concerned that so many restrictions would make mealtime boring, so, together with Julia Turshen, she compiled a collection of 185 delicious, easy recipes that followed her doctor's guidelines. And it worked! After changing her diet, Paltrow healed totally, felt more energetic and looked great. Now, in IT'S ALL GOOD, she shares the go-to dishes that have become the baseline for the restorative diet she turns to whenever she feels she needs it. Recipes include: Huevos Rancheros, Hummus Tartine with Scallion-Mint Pesto, Salmon Burgers with Pickled Ginger, even Power Brownies, Banana \"Ice Cream,\" and more!",

            "description": "The founder and president of PETA, Ingrid Newkirk, and bestselling author Gene Stone explore the wonders of animal life and offer tools for living more kindly toward them.In the last few decades, a wealth of new information has emerged about who animals are\u2014intelligent, aware, and empathetic. Studies show that animals are astounding beings with intelligence, emotions, intricate communications networks, and myriad abilities. In Animalkind, Ingrid Newkirk and Gene Stone present these findings in a concise and awe-inspiring way, detailing a range of surprising discoveries: that geese fall in love and stay with a partner for life, that fish \u201csing\u201d underwater, and that elephants use their trunks to send subsonic signals, alerting other herds to danger miles away.Newkirk and Stone pair their tour of the astounding lives of animals with a guide to the exciting new tools that allow humans to avoid using or abusing animals as we once did. They show readers what they can do in their everyday lives to ensure that the animal world is protected from needless harm. Whether it\u2019s medicine, product testing, entertainment, clothing, or food, there are now better options to all the uses animals once served in human life. We can substitute warmer, lighter faux fleece for wool, choose vegan versions of everything from shrimp to sausage and milk to marshmallows, reap the benefits of medical research that no longer requires monkeys to be caged in laboratories, and scrap captive orca exhibits and elephant rides for virtual reality and animatronics.\u200dAnimalkind is a fascinating study of why our fellow living beings deserve our respect, and moreover, the steps every reader can take to put this new understanding into action.",

Equal parts Paper Lion, Moneyball, Friday Night Lights, and The Office, this absorbing, funny, and vivid narrative gets to the heart of a massive and stressful collective endeavor.Here is football in many faces: the polarizing, brilliant, and hilarious head coach; the general manager, whose job is to support (and suppress) the irrepressible coach; the defensive coaches and their in-house rivals, the offensive coaches; and of course the players. Wise safeties, brooding linebackers, high-strung cornerbacks, enthusiastic rookies, and a well-read nose tackle-they make up a strange and complex family. Dawidoff makes an emblematic NFL season come alive for fans and nonfans alike in a book about football that will forever change the way people watch and think about the sport.",

            "description": "In Speed Trap, His first Public Revelations to go beyond his dramatic testimony before the Dubin Inquiry, Charlie Francis presents an insiders account of the world of international track and field.While telling a profoundly human story, Francis shatters the conspiracy of silence maintained by the international sports community surrounding drug use and addresses the central issues arising from the events at the Seoul Olympics. Was his star pupil, Ben Johnson, the exception \u2013 or are performance enhancing drugs commonplace among the world\u2019s track stars? Is it possible to beat the world\u2019s elite athletes without using anabolic steroids? And what \u2013 if anything- can be done to make the sports arena fair, safe and honest?Speed Trap traces the history of performance-enhancing substances from ancient Greece to present, and explains how steroids came to be entrenched within modern track and field by 1972, when Charlie Francis himself competed in the Munich Olympics. Francis reveals the corruption within the drug control bureaucracy and the hypocrisy leading to the occasional hunt of scapegoats- like the one that shocked the world by striping Ben Johnson of his gold medal.The book also provides a window onto the riotous international track circuit and illustrates the clash of egos that makes and sustains the great rivalries- first and foremost the series of high stake showdowns between Ben Johnson and Carl Lewis.Charlie Francis has both the knowledge and the freedom to speak candidly about track and field. Speed Trap is the product of that candor, a book that will surprise Canadians.Charlie Francis, three times a Canadian Sprint champion, served as a national sprint coach for 9 years. He developed athletes who won nine Olympic medals, and who set 23 world records, and more than 250 Canadian records. Four of his stars were ranked among the top ten in the world in their respective events.Jeff Coplon\u2019s writing has appeared in The New Yorker, New York magazine, The New York Times Magazine, and Rolling Stone, among other publications. He is the coauthor a dozen memoirs, notably with Tina Sinatra, Sarah Ferguson (the Duchess of York), and Cher. He is the author of Gold Buckle, the definitive treatment of rodeo bull riding (HarperOne, 1995). He resides in Brooklyn.",

            "description": "Herv' This (pronounced \"Teess\") is an internationally renowned chemist, a popular French television personality, a bestselling cookbook author, a longtime collaborator with the famed French chef Pierre Gagnaire, and the only person to hold a doctorate in molecular gastronomy, a cutting-edge field he pioneered. Bringing the instruments and experimental techniques of the laboratory into the kitchen, This uses recent research in the chemistry, physics, and biology of food to challenge traditional ideas about cooking and eating. What he discovers will entertain, instruct, and intrigue cooks, gourmets, and scientists alike.\u200dMolecular Gastronomy, This's first work to appear in English, is filled with practical tips, provocative suggestions, and penetrating insights. This begins by reexamining and debunking a variety of time-honored rules and dictums about cooking and presents new and improved ways of preparing a variety of dishes from quiches and quenelles to steak and hard-boiled eggs. He goes on to discuss the physiology of flavor and explores how the brain perceives tastes, how chewing affects food, and how the tongue reacts to various stimuli. Examining the molecular properties of bread, ham, foie gras, and champagne, the book analyzes what happens as they are baked, cured, cooked, and chilled.Looking to the future, Herv' This imagines new cooking methods and proposes novel dishes. A chocolate mousse without eggs? A flourless chocolate cake baked in the microwave? Molecular Gastronomy explains how to make them. This also shows us how to cook perfect French fries, why a souffl' rises and falls, how long to cool champagne, when to season a steak, the right way to cook pasta, how the shape of a wine glass affects the taste of wine, why chocolate turns white, and how salt modifies tastes.",

            "description": "Joy is the root of happiness.Joy is a sustainable state that fuels our creativity and inspiration for innovation. \u00a0It strengthens our ability to attract friends and to get along with people. \u00a0Learning to cultivate joy is the fundamental secret to success. In this long-awaited follow-up to the New York Times bestselling Search Inside Yourself, Chade-Meng Tan shows us how anyone, no matter where they are, can access this source of happiness.Meng writes, \u201cIf you have been unhappy, or you are happy and aspire to be even happier, know that your happiness set point can be upgraded. I know because I did it, I have seen many others do it, and scientific studies have measured it. Of course, Buddhist monks and other contemplative people have been doing it for thousands of years, but it\u2019s not something in the water in the Himalayas, it\u2019s something you can do too, wherever you are. I think the main problem is most people aren\u2019t aware that it is even possible. Or, if we\u2019ve heard of it, many of us think it is unattainable so we don\u2019t even try. We don\u2019t know it\u2019s something that every single one of us can learn.\u201dThe path to joy on demand is through mindfulness, but it doesn\u2019t have to be a lot of work, take a lot of time, or require you to abandon all your possessions and live in a hut on a remote island. In Joy on Demand, Chade-Meng Tan reveals the innate contentment that we all possess, and how to tap into this natural, infinite capacity for joy. The best part is that the benefits extend to every aspect of life\u2014our brains work better, our bodies function better, we achieve greater success at work, and we find ourselves highly attractive to the people around us. The more we exercise this skill, the more familiar we become with joy, the more we effortlessly gravitate toward it, and in so doing create a sustainable sense of wonder and contentment that can carry us throughout our entire life.

            "description": "Here is an extraordinary new approach to healing by an extraordinary physician-writer -- a book filled with the mystery, wonder, and hope of people who have experienced seemingly miraculous recoveries from cancer and other serious illnesses.Dr. Deepak Chopra, a respected New England endocrinologist, began his search for answers when he saw patients in his own practice who completely recovered after being given only a few months to live. In the mid-1980's he returned to his native India to explore Ayurveda, humanity's most ancient healing tradition. Now he has brought together the current research of Western medicine, neuroscience, and physics with the insights of Ayurvedic theory to show that the human body is controlled by a \"network of intelligence\" grounded in quantum reality. Not a superficial psychological state, this intelligence lies deep enough to change the basic patterns that design our physiology -- with the potential to defeat cancer, heart disease, and even aging itself. In this inspiring and pioneering work, Dr. Chopra offers us both a fascinating intellectual journey and a deeply moving chronicle of hope and healing.",

            "description": "From Gabrielle Hamilton, bestselling author of Blood, Bones & Butter, comes her eagerly anticipated cookbook debut filled with signature recipes from her celebrated New York City restaurant Prune.A self-trained cook turned James Beard Award\u2013winning chef, Gabrielle Hamilton opened Prune on New York\u2019s Lower East Side fifteen years ago to great acclaim and lines down the block, both of which continue today. A deeply personal and gracious restaurant, in both menu and philosophy, Prune uses the elements of home cooking and elevates them in unexpected ways. The result is delicious food that satisfies on many levels.Highly original in concept, execution, look, and feel, the Prune cookbook is an inspired replica of the restaurant\u2019s kitchen binders. It is written to Gabrielle\u2019s cooks in her distinctive voice, with as much instruction, encouragement, information, and scolding as you would find if you actually came to work at Prune as a line cook. The recipes have been tried, tasted, and tested dozens if not hundreds of times. Intended for the home cook as well as the kitchen professional, the instructions offer a range of signals for cooks\u2014a head\u2019s up on when you have gone too far, things to watch out for that could trip you up, suggestions on how to traverse certain uncomfortable parts of the journey to ultimately help get you to the final destination, an amazing dish.Complete with more than with more than 250 recipes and 250 color photographs, home cooks will find Prune\u2019s most requested recipes\u2014Grilled Head-on Shrimp with Anchovy Butter, Bread Heels and Pan Drippings Salad, Tongue and Octopus with Salsa Verde and Mimosa\u2019d Egg, Roasted Capon on Garlic Crouton, Prune\u2019s famous Bloody Mary (and all 10 variations). Plus, among other items, a chapter entitled \u201cGarbage\u201d\u2014smart ways to repurpose foods that might have hit the garbage or stockpot in other restaurant kitchens but are turned into appetizing bites and notions at Prune.Featured here are the recipes, approach, philosophy, evolution, and nuances that make them distinctively Prune\u2019s. Unconventional and honest, in both tone and content, this book is a welcome expression of the cookbook as we know it.",

            "description": "Nadia Damaso loves food, but also loves to be healthy. In Eat Better Not Less she proves that healthy food isn't boring, and filling your body with the right ingredients can make you feel amazing. Instead of giving up on carbs and fats, Nadia will show that by choosing the right ones, you can still enjoy chocolate and pizza now and then too. Her philosophy is all about moderation, and making recipes easy for anyone with a busy life. With recipes for vegans, vegetarians, and meateaters alike, there really is something for everyone. Try banana ice cream or sweet couscous for breakfast. For main meals, Nadia features real pizzas and spelt tagliatelle as well as a pulled-chicken burger, and lighter alternatives such as a cauliflower-crust pizza or salmon tacos. There's a whole chapter on creative salads, as well as over 20 desserts, proving healthy doesn't mean you have to go without treats! Eat Better Not Less is really a bible for anyone looking to live a healthier lifestyle, without having to go hungry, or giving up delicious food.",

            "description": "Fantasy football, fantasy baseball, fantasy basketball, even fantasy sumo wrestling: the world of fantasy sports is huge, and still growing. Today, more than 35 million people in the United States and Canada spend hours upon hours each week on their fantasy sports teams. And as the Senior Fantasy Sports Analyst for ESPN, Matthew Berry is on the front lines of what has grown from a niche subculture into a national pastime.In his New York Times-bestselling Fantasy Life, Berry celebrates every aspect of the fantasy sports world. Brilliant trash talk. Unbelievable trophies. Insane draft day locations. Shake-your-head-in-disbelief punishments. Ingenious attempts at cheating. And surprisingly uplifting stories that remind us why we play these games in the first place.Written with the same award-winning style that has made Berry one of the most popular columnists on ESPN.com, Fantasy Life is a book for both hard-core fantasy players and people who have never played before. Between tales of love and hate, birth and death, tattoos and furry animal costumes, the White House Situation Room and a 126-pound golden pelican, Matthew chronicles his journey from a fourteen-year-old fantasy player to the face of fantasy sports for the largest sports media company in the world.Fantasy will save your life. Fantasy will set you free. And fantasy life is most definitely better than real life. You\u2019ll see.",

            "description": "Type 2 diabetes is a modern disease of carbohydrate intolerance, meaning your body isn\u2019t able to process carbohydrate (sugars and starches) normally. Consuming these foods results in high blood sugar, and over time, diabetic complications. Before the invention of insulin in the 1920s, physicians advised diabetics to avoid eating carbohydrates because of this intolerance. In contrast, modern advice is to eat carbohydrates and treat the resulting high blood sugar with medications and insulin. This \u201ceat carb and take medicine\u201d method increases the cost of diabetic care and does nothing to resolve the underlying disease and progression.The logical solution is to follow a low-carb ketogenic diet because it treats type 2 diabetes at the root cause. Avoiding carbs while enjoying foods rich in healthy fats and protein stabilizes blood sugar and reduces and in some cases, eliminates the need for diabetic medications. Conquer Type 2 Diabetes with a Ketogenic Diet has all the information you need to successfully take control of your diabetes. In addition to clear explanations of the science, this book includes personal success stories, information on blood sugar monitoring and insulin therapy, the foods to eat and to avoid, cooking tips, how to get started and personalize the diet, medication interactions and more.",

            "description": "Meditation within Eternity is a journey into the heart of being spiritual in the modern world. Practical yet provocative, it pushes the limits of what spirituality is conceived to be, more than just relaxation and bits of Zen wisdom, it is the extraordinary yet invisible aspect of the universe we have forgotten how to touch, hear and see.This guide offers simple methods to gain unlimited spiritual energy, a forgotten resource and why many fail to truly grow spiritually. It also solves the missing link to accessing higher consciousness. It is the natural magnetic sense, or sixth sense, each of us possesses. The universe, reality, is molded by magnetism. We have an organic body, and an electric one. This electric, energy body, is capable of tapping the electromagnetic nature of reality. Following simple techniques and practical advice you will learn how it is possible to tap into the source code of reality.Meditation within Eternity provides practical, short meditation techniques for real spiritual growth. It serves a humble purpose \u2013 to give you the ability to experience spiritual awakening for yourself.",

Funny and intelligent, it offers a view into cricket life on and off the pitch and what makes cricket tick for both its fans and players. Far from the glamour of playing for Australia and uncomfortably close to the long drop to amateurism, this narrative illustrates the pressure and excitement of a player when every match is rife with the possibility of being discovered and propelled into international stardom in the baggy green.",

Why does being near water set our minds and bodies at ease? In Blue Mind, Wallace J. Nichols revolutionizes how we think about these questions, revealing the remarkable truth about the benefits of being in, on, under, or simply near water. Combining cutting-edge neuroscience with compelling personal stories from top athletes, leading scientists, military veterans, and gifted artists, he shows how proximity to water can improve performance, increase calm, diminish anxiety, and increase professional success.Blue Mind not only illustrates the crucial importance of our connection to water-it provides a paradigm shifting \"blueprint\" for a better life on this Blue Marble we call home.",

            "description": "A classic of reportage, Oranges was first conceived as a short magazine article about oranges and orange juice, but the author kept encountering so much irresistible information that he eventually found that he had in fact written a book. It contains sketches of orange growers, orange botanists, orange pickers, orange packers, early settlers on Florida's Indian River, the first orange barons, modern concentrate makers, and a fascinating profile of Ben Hill Griffin of Frostproof, Florida who may be the last of the individual orange barons.McPhee's astonishing book has an almost narrative progression, is immensely readable, and is frequently amusing. Louis XIV hung tapestries of oranges in the halls of Versailles, because oranges and orange trees were the symbols of his nature and his reign. This book, in a sense, is a tapestry of oranges, too\u2015with elements in it that range from the great orangeries of European monarchs to a custom of people in the modern Caribbean who split oranges and clean floors with them, one half in each hand.",

            "description": "Japan is the pre-eminent food nation on earth. The Japanese go to the most extraordinary lengths and expense to eat the finest, most delectable, and downright freakiest food imaginable. Their creativity, dedication and ingenuity, not to mention courage in the face of dishes such as cod sperm, whale penis and octopus ice cream, is only now beginning to be fully appreciated in the sushi-saturated West, as are the remarkable health benefits of the traditional Japanese diet.Inspired by Shizuo Tsuji's classic book, Japanese Cooking, A Simple Art, food and travel writer Michael Booth sets off to take the culinary pulse of contemporary Japan, learning fascinating tips and recipes that few westerners have been privy to before. Accompanied by with two fussy eaters under the age of six, he and his wife travel the length of the country, from bear-infested, beer-loving Hokkaido to snake-infested, seaweed-loving Okinawa.Along the way, they dine with - and score a surprising victory over - sumos; meet the indigenous Ainu; drink coffee at the dog caf\u00e9; pamper the world's most expensive cows with massage and beer; discover the secret of the Okinawan people's remarkable longevity; share a seaside lunch with free-diving, female abalone hunters; and meet the greatest chefs working in Japan today. Less happily, they trash a Zen garden, witness a mass fugu slaughter, are traumatised by an encounter with giant crabs, and attempt a calamitous cooking demonstration for the lunching ladies of Kyoto. They also ask, 'Who are you?' to the most famous TV stars in Japan.What do the Japanese know about food? Perhaps more than anyone on else on earth, judging by this fascinating and funny journey through an extraordinary food-obsessed country.",

            "description": "A \u201cthoroughly captivating biography\u201d (The San Francisco Chronicle) of American icon Arthur Ashe\u2014the Jackie Robinson of men\u2019s tennis\u2014a pioneering athlete who, after breaking the color barrier, went on to become an influential civil rights activist and public intellectual.Born in Richmond, Virginia, in 1943, by the age of eleven, Arthur Ashe was one of the state\u2019s most talented black tennis players. He became the first African American to play for the US Davis Cup team in 1963, and two years later he won the NCAA singles championship. In 1968, he rose to a number one national ranking. Turning professional in 1969, he soon became one of the world\u2019s most successful tennis stars, winning the Australian Open in 1970 and Wimbledon in 1975. After retiring in 1980, he served four years as the US Davis Cup captain and was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1985.In this \u201cdeep, detailed, thoughtful chronicle\u201d (The New York Times Book Review), Raymond Arsenault chronicles Ashe\u2019s rise to stardom on the court. But much of the book explores his off-court career as a human rights activist, philanthropist, broadcaster, writer, businessman, and celebrity. In the 1970s and 1980s, Ashe gained renown as an advocate for sportsmanship, education, racial equality, and the elimination of apartheid in South Africa. But from 1979 on, he was forced to deal with a serious heart condition that led to multiple surgeries and blood transfusions, one of which left him HIV-positive. After devoting the last ten months of his life to AIDS activism, Ashe died in February 1993 at the age of forty-nine, leaving an inspiring legacy of dignity, integrity, and active citizenship.Based on prodigious research, including more than one hundred interviews, Arthur Ashe puts Ashe in the context of both his time and the long struggle of African-American athletes seeking equal opportunity and respect, and \u201cwill serve as the standard work on Ashe for some time\u201d (Library Journal, starred review).",

            "description": "Together is a film that celebrates the power of food to bring people together.Following the Grenfell Tower fire, a group of local ladies got together to make healthy meals for their family and neighbors.They realized the power of cooking and dining together to form relationships, restore hope and normalcy, and convey a sense of home over the banter and fragrances of the kitchen. The Hubb Community Kitchen was born out of this. Together is a fairytale about this West London neighborhood, with over 50 delectable recipes from the Hubb Community Kitchen's women, as well as a preface from HRH The Duchess of Sussex.The women ask you to prepare their favourite simple foods from the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, and the Eastern Mediterranean for you and your loved ones, many of which have been passed down through generations.Every meal has a narrative to tell about history, culture, and family, and it has been created with minimal ingredients and simple procedures in mind so that anybody can prepare these unique dishes.Green Chilli and Avocado Dip, Coconut Chicken Curry, Aubergine Masala, Persian Chicken with Barberry Rice, Caramelised Plum Upside-Down Cake, Spiced Mint Tea, and many more dishes are included in Together.This beautiful charity cookbook is a celebration of life, friendship, and community.",

            "description": "A hidden epidemic races around the globe -- we can't see it or touch it, which makes it so dangerous. The invisible epidemic has led to the suffering of millions who spend billions on drugs, only to find they don't work. This is an epidemic of broken brains.\"Broken brains\" go by many names -- depression, anxiety, memory loss, brain fog, attention deficit disorder, autism, and dementia, to name a few -- and show up in radically different ways from person to person, making each seem like a separate problem.But the truth is that these \"diagnoses\" are all the result of a few basic problems with our biology. Pinpoint these biological problems, fix them, and let your body's natural healing intelligence take over to repair your brain. Now you can experience an UltraMind -- one that is highly focused and able to pay attention at will, with a strong, reliable memory and a mood that is calm, confident, in control, and in good spirits.We have all heard of the mind-body connection or how our thoughts affect the health of our body. But the reverse is far more powerful: what you do to your body, your basic biology, has a profound effect on your brain.Have you ever experienced instant clarity after exercise? Alertness after drinking coffee? A mental crash after popping candy? Does your brain inexplicably slow down during stress, while multitasking, or when meeting a deadline? Each is an example of how what we do to our bodies -- whether through nutrition, sleep, exercise, or stress -- has a dramatic effect on our brains.Conventional treatments don't help, or provide only slight benefit, because they just manage symptoms rather than deal with -- and heal -- the underlying problem. And just as brain problems all stem from the same root causes, they all have the same solution -- The UltraMind Solution.Our ancient genes interact with our environment to create systemic imbalances that affect our brains. Correct those imbalances -- most caused by nutritional deficiencies, allergens, infections, toxins, and stress -- and you can achieve optimum mental health without drugs or psychotherapy.The UltraMind Solution is the future of medicine, the culmination of the last twenty years of research on what makes the brain happy, focused, and calm; research that has uncovered a few simple factors that explain why things go wrong and how to fix them.Don't wait for this revolution in medicine to trickle into your doctor's office: it usually takes research twenty years to move from the lab to the patient. The answers are here, right now, in The UltraMind Solution.",

            "description": "Named a Best Book of the Year by The Washington Post, The New York Times Book Review, NPR, and Chicago Tribune, now in paperback with a new reading group guide.Medicine has triumphed in modern times, transforming the dangers of childbirth, injury, and disease from harrowing to manageable. But when it comes to the inescapable realities of aging and death, what medicine can do often runs counter to what it should.Through eye-opening research and gripping stories of his own patients and family, Gawande reveals the suffering this dynamic has produced. Nursing homes, devoted above all to safety, battle with residents over the food they are allowed to eat and the choices they are allowed to make. Doctors, uncomfortable discussing patients' anxieties about death, fall back on false hopes and treatments that are actually shortening lives instead of improving them.In his bestselling books, Atul Gawande, a practicing surgeon, has fearlessly revealed the struggles of his profession. Now he examines its ultimate limitations and failures-in his own practices as well as others'-as life draws to a close. Riveting, honest, and humane, Being Mortal shows how the ultimate goal is not a good death but a good life-all the way to the very end.",

            "description": "The Divided Mind is the crowning achievement of Dr. John E. Sarno's distinguished career as a groundbreaking medical pioneer, going beyond pain to address the entire spectrum of psychosomatic (mindbody) disorders.The interaction between the generally reasonable, rational, ethical, moral conscious mind and the repressed feelings of emotional pain, hurt, sadness, and anger characteristic of the unconscious mind appears to be the basis for mindbody disorders. The Divided Mind traces the history of psychosomatic medicine, including Freud's crucial role, and describes the psychology responsible for the broad range of psychosomatic illness. The failure of medicine's practitioners to recognize and appropriately treat mindbody disorders has produced public health and economic problems of major proportions in the United States.One of the most important aspects of psychosomatic phenomena is that knowledge and awareness of the process clearly have healing powers. Thousands of people have become pain-free simply by reading Dr. Sarno's previous books. How and why this happens is a fascinating story, and is revealed in The Divided Mind.",

            "description": "Wouldn\u2019t you like to live longer? And better? In this operating manual for longevity, Dr. Peter Attia draws on the latest science to deliver innovative nutritional interventions, techniques for optimizing exercise and sleep, and tools for addressing emotional and mental health.For all its successes, mainstream medicine has failed to make much progress against the diseases of aging that kill most people: heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and type 2 diabetes. Too often, it intervenes with treatments too late to help, prolonging lifespan at the expense of healthspan, or quality of life. Dr. Attia believes we must replace this outdated framework with a personalized, proactive strategy for longevity, one where we take action now, rather than waiting.\u00a0This is not \u201cbiohacking,\u201d it\u2019s science: a well-founded strategic and tactical approach to extending lifespan while also improving our physical, cognitive, and emotional health. Dr. Attia\u2019s aim is less to tell you\u00a0what to do\u00a0and more to help you learn\u00a0how to think\u00a0about long-term health, in order to create the best plan for you as an individual. In\u00a0Outlive, readers will discover:\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Why the cholesterol test at your annual physical doesn\u2019t tell you enough about your actual risk of dying from a heart attack.\u2022\u00a0That you may already suffer from an extremely common yet underdiagnosed liver condition that could be a precursor to the chronic diseases of aging.\u2022\u00a0Why exercise is the most potent pro-longevity \u201cdrug\u201d\u2014and how to begin training for the \u201cCentenarian Decathlon.\u201d\u2022\u00a0Why you should forget about diets, and focus instead on\u00a0nutritional biochemistry,\u00a0using technology and data to personalize your eating pattern.\u2022\u00a0Why striving for physical health and longevity, but ignoring emotional health, could be the ultimate curse of all.\u00a0Aging and longevity are far more malleable than we think; our fate is not set in stone. With the right roadmap, you can plot a different path for your life, one that lets you outlive your genes to make each decade better than the one before.",

            "description": "There's a silent epidemic in western civilization, and it is right under our noses. Our jaws are getting smaller and our teeth crooked and crowded, creating not only aesthetic challenges but also difficulties with breathing. Modern orthodontics has persuaded us that braces and oral devices can correct these problems. While teeth can certainly be straightened, what about the underlying causes of this rapid shift in oral evolution and the health risks posed by obstructed airways?Sandra Kahn and Paul R. Ehrlich, a pioneering orthodontist and a world-renowned evolutionist, respectively, present the biological, dietary, and cultural changes that have driven us toward this major health challenge. They propose simple adjustments that can alleviate this developing crisis, as well as a major alternative to orthodontics that promises more significant long-term relief. Jaws will change your life. Every parent should read this book.",

            "description": "Imagine, if you will, a disease\u2014one that has only subtle outward symptoms but can hijack your entire body without notice, one that transfers easily between parent and child, one that can last a lifetime if untreated. According to Dr. Paul Conti, this is exactly how society should conceptualize trauma: as an out-of-control epidemic with a potentially fatal prognosis. In Trauma: The Invisible Epidemic, Dr. Conti examines the most recent research, clinical best practices, and dozens of real-life stories to present a deeper and more urgent view of trauma. Not only does Dr. Conti explain how trauma affects the body and mind, he also demonstrates that trauma is transmissible among close family and friends, as well as across generations and within vast demographic groups. With all this in mind, Trauma: The Invisible Epidemic proposes a course of treatment for the seemingly untreatable. Here, Dr. Conti traces a step-by-step series of concrete changes that we can make both as individuals and as a society to alleviate trauma\u2019s effects and prevent further traumatization in the future. You will discover:- The different post-trauma syndromes, how they are classified, and their common symptoms- An examination of how for-profit health care systems can inhibit diagnosis and treatment of trauma- How social crises and political turmoil encourage the spread of group trauma- Methods for confronting and managing your fears as they arise in the moment- How trauma disrupts mental processes such as memory, emotional regulation, and logical decision-making- The argument for a renewed humanist social commitment to mental health and wellness\u200dIt\u2019s only when we understand how a disease spreads and is sustained that we are able to create its ultimate cure. With Trauma: The Invisible Epidemic, Dr. Conti reveals that what we once considered a lifelong, unbeatable mental illness is both treatable and preventable.",

David Quammen expertly shows how strange new viruses emerge from animals into humans as we disrupt wild ecosystems, and how those viruses adapt to their human hosts, sometimes causing global catastrophe. He explains why this coronavirus will probably be a \u201cforever virus,\u201d destined to circulate among humans and bedevil us endlessly, in one variant form or another. As scientists labor to catch it, comprehend it, and control it, with their high-tech tools and methods, the virus finds ways of escape.",
