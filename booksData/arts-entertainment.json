            "description": "The ultimate guide to human-centered design.Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch or oven burner to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door.The fault, argues this ingenious -- even liberating -- book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization.The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time.The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how -- and why -- some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.",

            "description": "In the midseventies, Steve Martin exploded onto the comedy scene. By 1978 he was the biggest concert draw in the history of stand-up. In 1981 he quit forever. This book is, in his own words, the story of \"why I did stand-up and why I walked away.\"Emmy and Grammy Award winner, author of the acclaimed New York Times bestsellers Shopgirl and The Pleasure of My Company, and a regular contributor to The New Yorker, Martin has always been a writer. His memoir of his years in stand-up is candid, spectacularly amusing, and beautifully written.At age ten Martin started his career at Disneyland, selling guidebooks in the newly opened theme park. In the decade that followed, he worked in the Disney magic shop and the Bird Cage Theatre at Knott's Berry Farm, performing his first magic/comedy act a dozen times a week. The story of these years, during which he practiced and honed his craft, is moving and revelatory. The dedication to excellence and innovation is formed at an astonishingly early age and never wavers or wanes.Martin illuminates the sacrifice, discipline, and originality that made him an icon and informs his work to this day. To be this good, to perform so frequently, was isolating and lonely. It took Martin decades to reconnect with his parents and sister, and he tells that story with great tenderness. Martin also paints a portrait of his times-the era of free love and protests against the war in Vietnam, the heady irreverence of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in the late sixties, and the transformative new voice of Saturday Night Live in the seventies.Throughout the text, Martin has placed photographs, many never seen before. Born Standing Up is a superb testament to the sheer tenacity, focus, and daring of one of the greatest and most iconoclastic comedians of all time.",

Bound in innocence and enthusiasm, they traversed the city from Coney Island to Forty-Second Street, and eventually to the celebrated round table of Max\u2019s Kansas City, where the Andy Warhol contingent held court. In 1969, the pair set up camp at the Hotel Chelsea and soon entered a community of the famous and infamous, the influential artists of the day and the colorful fringe. It was a time of heightened awareness, when the worlds of poetry, rock and roll, art, and sexual politics were colliding and exploding. In this milieu, two kids made a pact to take care of each other. Scrappy, romantic, committed to create, and fueled by their mutual dreams and drives, they would prod and provide for one another during the hungry years.Just Kids begins as a love story and ends as an elegy. It serves as a salute to New York City during the late sixties and seventies and to its rich and poor, its hustlers and hellions. A true fable, it is a portrait of two young artists\u2019 ascent, a prelude to fame.",

            "description": "At the core of A Pattern Language is the philosophy that in designing their environments people always rely on certain \u2018languages,\u2019 which, like the languages we speak, allow them to articulate and communicate an infinite variety of designs within a formal system which gives them coherence.This book provides a language of this kind. It will enable making a design for almost any kind of building, or any part of the built environment. \u2018Patterns,\u2019 the units of this language, are answers to design problems: how high should a window sill be?; how many stories should a building have?; how much space in a neighborhood should be devoted to grass and trees?More than 250 of the patterns in this language are outlined, each consisting of a problem statement, a discussion of the problem with an illustration, and a solution. As the authors say in their introduction, many of the patterns are archetypal, so deeply rooted in the nature of things that it seems likely that they will be a part of human nature and human action as much in five hundred years as they are today.\u200dA Pattern Language is related to Alexander\u2019s other works in the Center for Environmental Structure series: The Timeless Way of Building (introductory volume) and The Oregon Experiment.",

How Buildings Learn is a masterful new synthesis that proposes that buildings adapt best when constantly refined and reshaped by their occupants, and that architects can mature from being artists of space to becoming artists of time.From the connected farmhouses of New England to I.M. Pei's Media Lab, from \"satisficing\" to \"form follows funding,\" from the evolution of bungalows to the invention of Santa Fe Style, from Low Road military surplus buildings to a High Road English classic like Chatsworth\u2014this is a far-ranging survey of unexplored essential territory.More than any other human artifacts, buildings improve with time\u2014if they're allowed to. How Buildings Learn shows how to work with time rather than against it.",

Part memoir, part master class by one of the best-selling authors of all time, this superb volume is a revealing and practical view of the writer's craft, comprising the basic tools of the trade every writer must have. King's counsel is based on his vivid experiences from infancy through his emergence as a writer, from his early struggles to his well publicized near-fatal accident in 1999\u2014and how the inextricable link between writing and living aided his recovery. On Writing will inspire and excite everyone who reads it\u2014fans, authors, and anybody who enjoys a well-told narrative. It is brilliantly constructed, accessible, and encouraging.",

Now, in an even more forward-thinking and necessary book, he shows how to take that critical next step on a creative journey\u2015getting known.Show Your Work! is about why generosity trumps genius. It\u2019s about getting findable, about using the network instead of wasting time \u201cnetworking.\u201d It\u2019s not self-promotion, it\u2019s self-discovery\u2015let others into your process, then let them steal from you. Filled with illustrations, quotes, stories, and examples, Show Your Work! offers ten transformative rules for being open, generous, brave, productive.In chapters such as You Don\u2019t Have to Be a Genius; Share Something Small Every Day; and Stick Around, Kleon creates a user\u2019s manual for embracing the communal nature of creativity\u2015 what he calls the \u201cecology of talent.\u201d From broader life lessons about work (you can\u2019t find your voice if you don\u2019t use it) to the etiquette of sharing\u2015and the dangers of oversharing\u2015to the practicalities of Internet life (build a good domain name; give credit when credit is due), it\u2019s an inspiring manifesto for succeeding as any kind of artist or entrepreneur in the digital age.",

In a series of playful but expertly wrought essays, John McPhee shares insights he's gathered over his career and refined during his long-running course at Princeton University, where he has launched some of the most esteemed writers of several generations. McPhee offers a definitive guide to the crucial decisions regarding structure, diction, and tone that shape nonfiction pieces, and presents extracts from some of his best-loved work, subjecting them to wry scrutiny. The result is a vivid depiction of the writing process, from reporting to drafting to revising and revising, and revising.More than a compendium of advice, Draft No. 4 is enriched by personal detail and charming reflections on the life of a writer. McPhee describes his enduring relationships with The New Yorker and Farrar, Straus and Giroux, and recalls his early years at Time magazine. Enlivened by his keen sense of writing as a way of being in the world, Draft No. 4 is the long-awaited master class given by America's most renowned writing instructor.",

            "description": "Many consider the tragedy of \"Hamlet\" to be Shakespeare's masterpiece and one of the greatest plays of all time. It has entertained audiences for centuries and the role of Hamlet is one of the most sought after by actors. It is the story of Hamlet, the Prince of Denmark who learns of the death of his father at the hands of his uncle, Claudius. Claudius murders Hamlet's father, his own brother, to take the throne of Denmark and to marry Hamlet's widowed mother. Hamlet is sunk into a state of great despair as a result of discovering the murder of his father and the infidelity of his mother. Hamlet is torn between his great sadness and his desire for the revenge of his father's murder.\"Hamlet\" is a work of great complexity and as such has drawn many different critical interpretations. Hamlet has been seen as a victim of circumstance, as an impractical idealist, as the sufferer of an Oedipus complex, as an opportunist wishing to kill his Uncle not for revenge but to ascend to the throne, as the sufferer of a great melancholy, and as a man blinded by his desire for revenge. The true motivations of Hamlet are complex and enigmatic and have been debated for centuries. Read this classic tragedy and decide for yourself where Hamlet's true motivations lie and how they influence his ultimate demise.",

Munari insisted that design be beautiful, functional and accessible, and this enlightening and highly entertaining book sets out his ideas about visual, graphic and industrial design and the role it plays in the objects we use everyday. Lamps, road signs, typography, posters, children's books, advertising, cars and chairs - these are just some of the subjects to which he turns his illuminating gaze.",

This book helps students, academics and nonfiction writers to get more done, write intelligent texts and learn for the long run. It teaches you how to take smart notes and ensure they bring you and your projects forward.The Take Smart Notes principle is based on established psychological insight and draws from a tried and tested note-taking-technique. This is the first comprehensive guide and description of this system in English, and not only does it explain how it works, but also why. It suits students and academics in the social sciences and humanities, nonfiction writers and others who are in the business of reading, thinking and writing.Instead of wasting your time searching for notes, quotes or references, you can focus on what really counts: thinking, understanding and developing new ideas in writing. It does not matter if you prefer taking notes with pen and paper or on a computer, be it Windows, Mac or Linux. And you can start right away.",

            "description": "In this groundbreaking union of art and science, rocker-turned-neuroscientist Daniel J. Levitin explores the connection between music\u2014its performance, its composition, how we listen to it, why we enjoy it\u2014and the human brain.Taking on prominent thinkers who argue that music is nothing more than an evolutionary accident, Levitin poses that music is fundamental to our species, perhaps even more so than language. Drawing on the latest research and on musical examples ranging from Mozart to Duke Ellington to Van Halen, he reveals:How composers produce some of the most pleasurable effects of listening to music by exploiting the way our brains make sense of the worldWhy we are so emotionally attached to the music we listened to as teenagers, whether it was Fleetwood Mac, U2, or Dr. DreThat practice, rather than talent, is the driving force behind musical expertiseHow those insidious little jingles (called earworms) get stuck in our headA Los Angeles Times Book Award finalist, This Is Your Brain on Music will attract readers of Oliver Sacks and David Byrne, as it is an unprecedented, eye-opening investigation into an obsession at the heart of human nature.",

            "description": "The #1 New York Times Bestseller.A hilarious, thoughtful, and in-depth exploration of the pleasures and perils of modern romance from Aziz Ansari, the star of Master of None and one of this generation\u2019s sharpest comedic voicesAt some point, every one of us embarks on a journey to find love. We meet people, date, get into and out of relationships, all with the hope of finding someone with whom we share a deep connection. This seems standard now, but it\u2019s wildly different from what people did even just decades ago. Single people today have more romantic options than at any point in human history. With technology, our abilities to connect with and sort through these options are staggering. So why are so many people frustrated?Some of our problems are unique to our time. \u201cWhy did this guy just text me an emoji of a pizza?\u201d \u201cShould I go out with this girl even though she listed Combos as one of her favorite snack foods? Combos?!\u201d \u201cMy girlfriend just got a message from some dude named Nathan. Who\u2019s Nathan? Did he just send her a photo of his penis? Should I check just to be sure?\u201d But the transformation of our romantic lives can\u2019t be explained by technology alone. In a short period of time, the whole culture of finding love has changed dramatically. A few decades ago, people would find a decent person who lived in their neighborhood. Their families would meet and, after deciding neither party seemed like a murderer, they would get married and soon have a kid, all by the time they were twenty-four. Today, people marry later than ever and spend years of their lives on a quest to find the perfect person, a soul mate.For years, Aziz Ansari has been aiming his comic insight at modern romance, but for Modern Romance, the book, he decided he needed to take things to another level. He teamed up with NYU sociologist Eric Klinenberg and designed a massive research project, including hundreds of interviews and focus groups conducted everywhere from Tokyo to Buenos Aires to Wichita. They analyzed behavioral data and surveys and created their own online research forum on Reddit, which drew thousands of messages. They enlisted the world\u2019s leading social scientists, including Andrew Cherlin, Eli Finkel, Helen Fisher, Sheena Iyengar, Barry Schwartz, Sherry Turkle, and Robb Willer. The result is unlike any social science or humor book we\u2019ve seen before.In Modern Romance, Ansari combines his irreverent humor with cutting-edge social science to give us an unforgettable tour of our new romantic world.",

Rooted in Lewis\u2019 personal story, it also reflects on the highs and lows of the broader civil rights movement.Book One spans John Lewis\u2019 youth in rural Alabama, his life-changing meeting with Martin Luther King, Jr., the birth of the Nashville Student Movement, and their battle to tear down segregation through nonviolent lunch counter sit-ins, building to a stunning climax on the steps of City Hall.Many years ago, John Lewis and other student activists drew inspiration from the 1950s comic book \"Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story.\" Now, his own comics bring those days to life for a new audience, testifying to a movement whose echoes will be heard for generations.",

            "description": "\u201cWriting about yourself is a funny business\u2026But in a project like this, the writer has made one promise, to show the reader his mind. In these pages, I\u2019ve tried to do this.\u201d \u2014Bruce Springsteen, from the pages of Born to Run\u200dIn 2009, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band performed at the Super Bowl\u2019s halftime show. The experience was so exhilarating that Bruce decided to write about it. That\u2019s how this extraordinary autobiography began.Over the past seven years, Bruce Springsteen has privately devoted himself to writing the story of his life, bringing to these pages the same honesty, humor, and originality found in his songs.He describes growing up Catholic in Freehold, New Jersey, amid the poetry, danger, and darkness that fueled his imagination, leading up to the moment he refers to as \u201cThe Big Bang\u201d: seeing Elvis Presley\u2019s debut on The Ed Sullivan Show. He vividly recounts his relentless drive to become a musician, his early days as a bar band king in Asbury Park, and the rise of the E Street Band. With disarming candor, he also tells for the first time the story of the personal struggles that inspired his best work, and shows us why the song \u201cBorn to Run\u201d reveals more than we previously realized.\u200dBorn to Run will be revelatory for anyone who has ever enjoyed Bruce Springsteen, but this book is much more than a legendary rock star\u2019s memoir. This is a book for workers and dreamers, parents and children, lovers and loners, artists, freaks, or anyone who has ever wanted to be baptized in the holy river of rock and roll.Rarely has a performer told his own story with such force and sweep. Like many of his songs (\u201cThunder Road,\u201d \u201cBadlands,\u201d \u201cDarkness on the Edge of Town,\u201d \u201cThe River,\u201d \u201cBorn in the U.S.A.,\u201d \u201cThe Rising,\u201d and \u201cThe Ghost of Tom Joad,\u201d to name just a few), Bruce Springsteen\u2019s autobiography is written with the lyricism of a singular songwriter and the wisdom of a man who has thought deeply about his experiences.",

These have now been corrected in one place for the first time by Stevens scholars John N. Serio and Christopher Beyers, based on original editions and manuscripts. The Collected Poems is the one volume that Stevens intended to contain all the poems he wished to preserve, presented in the way he wanted. An essential collection for all readers of poetry, it is an enduring monument to his dazzling achievement.",

            "description": "In Catching the Big Fish, internationally acclaimed filmmaker David Lynch provides a rare window into his methods as an artist, his personal working style, and the immense creative benefits he has experienced from the practice of meditation.Lynch describes the experience of \"diving within\" and \"catching\" ideas like fish - and then preparing them for television or movie screens, and other mediums in which he works, such as painting, music, and design. Lynch writes for the first time about his more than three-decade commitment to Transcendental Meditation and the difference it has made in his creative process.In brief chapters, Lynch explains the development of his ideas - where they came from, how he grasps them, and which ones appeal to him the most. He specifically discusses how he puts his thoughts into action and how he engages with others around him. Finally, he considers the self and the surrounding world - and how the process of \"diving within\" that has so deeply affected his own work can directly benefit others.\u200dCatching the Big Fish comes as a revelation to the legion of fans who have longed to better understand Lynch's personal vision. And it is equally intriguing to those who wonder how they can nurture their own creativity.",

            "description": "When Hugh MacLeod was a struggling young copywriter living in a YMCA, he started to doodle on the backs of business cards while sitting at a bar. Those cartoons eventually led to a popular blog-gapingvoid.com-and a reputation for pithy insight and humor, in both words and pictures.MacLeod has opinions on everything from marketing to the meaning of life, but one of his main subjects is creativity. How do new ideas emerge in a cynical, risk-averse world? Where does inspiration come from? What does it take to make a living as a creative person?Ignore Everybody expands on MacLeod's sharpest insights, wittiest cartoons, and most useful advice.For example:Selling out is harder than it looks. Diluting your product to make it more commercial will just make people like it less.If your plan depends on you suddenly being \"discovered\" by some big shot, your plan will probably fail. Nobody suddenly discovers anything. Things are made slowly and in pain.Don't try to stand out from the crowd; avoid crowds altogether. There's no point trying to do the same thing as 250,000 other young hopefuls, waiting for a miracle. All existing business models are wrong. Find a new one.The idea doesn't have to be big. It just has to be yours. The sovereignty you have over your work will inspire far more people than the actual content ever will.After learning MacLeod's forty keys to creativity, you will be ready to unlock your own brilliance and unleash it on the world.",

Now Naifeh and Smith have written another tour de force\u2014an exquisitely detailed, compellingly readable, and ultimately heartbreaking portrait of creative genius Vincent van Gogh.Working with the full cooperation of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, Naifeh and Smith have accessed a wealth of previously untapped materials. While drawing liberally from the artist\u2019s famously eloquent letters, they have also delved into hundreds of unpublished family correspondences, illuminating with poignancy the wanderings of Van Gogh\u2019s troubled, restless soul. Naifeh and Smith bring a crucial understanding to the larger-than-life mythology of this great artist\u2014his early struggles to find his place in the world; his intense relationship with his brother Theo; his impetus for turning to brush and canvas; and his move to Provence, where in a brief burst of incandescent productivity he painted some of the best-loved works in Western art.The authors also shed new light on many unexplored aspects of Van Gogh\u2019s inner world: his deep immersion in literature and art; his erratic and tumultuous romantic life; and his bouts of depression and mental illness.Though countless books have been written about Van Gogh, and though the broad outlines of his tragedy have long inhabited popular culture, no serious, ambitious examination of his life has been attempted in more than seventy years. Naifeh and Smith have re-created Van Gogh\u2019s life with an astounding vividness and psychological acuity that bring a completely new and sympathetic understanding to this unique artistic genius whose signature images of sunflowers and starry nights have won a permanent place in the human imagination.",

            "description": "John Berger\u2019s seminal text on how to look at art.John Berger's Ways of Seeing is one of the most stimulating and the most influential books on art in any language. First published in 1972, it was based on the BBC television series about which the Sunday Times critic commented: \"This is an eye-opener in more ways than one: by concentrating on how we look at paintings . . . he will almost certainly change the way you look at pictures.\" By now he has.\"The influence of the series and the book . . . was enormous . . . It opened up for general attention to areas of cultural study that are now commonplace.\" \u2014Geoff Dyer\"Berger has the ability to cut right through the mystification of the professional art critics . . . He is a liberator of images: and once we have allowed the paintings to work on us directly, we are in a much better position to make a meaningful evaluation.\" \u2014Peter Fuller, Arts Review",

            "description": "\"I'd come from a long ways off and had started a long ways down. But now destiny was about to manifest itself. I felt like it was looking right at me and nobody else.\" So writes Bob Dylan in Chronicles: Volume One, his remarkable book exploring critical junctures in his life and career.Through Dylan's eyes and open mind, we see Greenwich Village, circa 1961, when he first arrives in Manhattan. Dylan's New York is a magical city of possibilities -- smoky, nightlong parties; literary awakenings; transient loves and unbreakable friendships. Elegiac observations are punctuated by jabs of memories, penetrating and tough. With the book's side trips to New Orleans, Woodstock, Minnesota and points west, Chronicles: Volume One is an intimate and intensely personal recollection of extraordinary times.By turns revealing, poetical, passionate and witty, Chronicles: Volume One is a mesmerizing window on Bob Dylan's thoughts and influences. Dylan's voice is distinctively American: generous of spirit, engaged, fanciful and rhythmic. Utilizing his unparalleled gifts of storytelling and the exquisite expressiveness that are the hallmarks of his music, Bob Dylan turns Chronicles: Volume One into a poignant reflection on life, and the people and places that helped shape the man and the art.",

            "description": "From the renowned director of the British Museum, a kaleidoscopic history of humanity told through things we have made.When did people first start to wear jewelry or play music? When were cows domesticated and why do we feed their milk to our children? Where were the first cities and what made them succeed? Who invented math-or came up with money?The history of humanity is a history of invention and innovation, as we have continually created new items to use, to admire, or to leave our mark on the world. In this original and thought-provoking book, Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum, has selected one hundred man-made artifacts, each of which gives us an intimate glimpse of an unexpected turning point in human civilization. A History of the World in 100 Objects stretches back two million years and covers the globe. From the very first hand axe to the ubiquitous credit card, each item has a story to tell; together they relate the larger history of mankind-revealing who we are by looking at what we have made.Handsomely designed, with more than 150 color photographs throughout the text, A History of the World in 100 Objects is a gorgeous reading book and makes a great gift for anyone interested in history.",

            "description": "The multitalented writers, directors, producers, and actors (as seen on The League, Transparent, and The Mindy Project) share the secrets of their lifelong partnership in this unique memoir.Whether producing, writing, directing, or acting, the Duplass Brothers have made their mark in the world of independent film and television on the strength of their quirky and empathetic approach to storytelling. Now, for the first time, Mark and Jay take readers on a tour of their lifelong partnership in this unique memoir told in essays that share the secrets of their success, the joys and frustrations of intimate collaboration, and the lessons they've learned the hard way.From a childhood spent wielding an oversized home video camera in the suburbs of New Orleans to their shared years at the University of Texas in early-nineties Austin, and from the breakthrough short they made on a three-dollar budget to the night their feature film Baghead became the center of a Sundance bidding war, Mark and Jay tell the story of a bond that's resilient, affectionate, mutually empowering, and only mildly dysfunctional. They are brutally honest about how their closeness sabotaged their youthful romantic relationships, about the jealousy each felt when the other stole the spotlight as an actor (Mark in The League, Jay in Transparent), and about the challenges they faced on the set of their HBO series Togetherness--namely, too much togetherness.But Like Brothers is also a surprisingly practical road map to a rewarding creative partnership. Rather than split all their responsibilities fifty-fifty, the brothers learned to capitalize on each other's strengths. They're not afraid to call each other out, because they're also not afraid to compromise. Most relationships aren't--and frankly shouldn't be--as intense as Mark and Jay's, but their brand of trust, validation, and healthy disagreement has taken them far.Part coming-of-age memoir, part underdog story, and part insider account of succeeding in Hollywood on their own terms, Like Brothers is as openhearted and lovably offbeat as Mark and Jay themselves.",

At once vulnerable and redemptive, dreamlike and visceral, compassionate and unforgiving, these poems seek a myriad existence without forgetting the prerequisite of self-preservation in a world bent on extinguishing its othered voices. Vuong's poems show, through breath, cadence, and unrepentant enthrallment, that a gentle palm on a chest can calm the most necessary of hungers.",

The Church of States is based in Utah.Vermont is known as the \"Old Hippie State.\"Florida is known as the \"Hot Mess State.\"Arizona is known as the \"Instagram Model State.\"Wisconsin: Tomorrow Is the First Day of the DietThe United States is in the midst of a fifty-state couples counselling session, with many couples considering divorce. Is it, however, what we actually want? Is it possible for a country made up of such disparate entities to stay together?From Connecticut to Hawaii, comedian, social critic, and writer and star of Red State Blue State and Unconstitutional, Colin Quinn, calls us out state by state. He points out the contradictions between what we say we believe and what we actually practise. Within the context of big-picture thinking about government systems\u2014after all, how would you put this country together today if you had to start from scratch? Overstated skewers us all: red, blue, and purple, from dead-on observations about the idiosyncrasies and vibes of the residents in each region to dead-on observations about the quirks and vibes of the citizens in each region. It's filled with the same mix of hope and reality that gave birth to the United States.",

            "description": "The Ephrussis were a grand banking family, as rich and respected as the Rothschilds, who \u201cburned like a comet\u201d in nineteenth-century Paris and Vienna society. Yet by the end of World War II, almost the only thing remaining of their vast empire was a collection of 264 wood and ivory carvings, none of them larger than a matchbox.The renowned ceramicist Edmund de Waal became the fifth generation to inherit this small and exquisite collection of netsuke. Entranced by their beauty and mystery, he determined to trace the story of his family through the story of the collection.The netsuke\u2014drunken monks, almost-ripe plums, snarling tigers\u2014were gathered by Charles Ephrussi at the height of the Parisian rage for all things Japanese. Charles had shunned the place set aside for him in the family business to make a study of art, and of beautiful living. An early supporter of the Impressionists, he appears, oddly formal in a top hat, in Renoir\u2019s Luncheon of the Boating Party. Marcel Proust studied Charles closely enough to use him as a model for the aesthete and lover Swann in Remembrance of Things Past.Charles gave the carvings as a wedding gift to his cousin Viktor in Vienna; his children were allowed to play with one netsuke each while they watched their mother, the Baroness Emmy, dress for ball after ball. Her older daughter grew up to disdain fashionable society. Longing to write, she struck up a correspondence with Rilke, who encouraged her in her poetry.The Anschluss changed their world beyond recognition. Ephrussi and his cosmopolitan family were imprisoned or scattered, and Hitler\u2019s theorist on the \u201cJewish question\u201d appropriated their magnificent palace on the Ringstrasse. A library of priceless books and a collection of Old Master paintings were confiscated by the Nazis. But the netsuke were smuggled away by a loyal maid, Anna, and hidden in her straw mattress. Years after the war, she would find a way to return them to the family she\u2019d served even in their exile.In The Hare with Amber Eyes, Edmund de Waal unfolds the story of a remarkable family and a tumultuous century. Sweeping yet intimate, it is a highly original meditation on art, history, and family, as elegant and precise as the netsuke themselves.",

Focusing on the mysteries--romantic, scientific, literary--that engage the minds and hearts of characters whose passions and lives intersect across scientific planes and centuries, it is \"Stoppard's richest, most ravishing comedy to date, a play of wit, intellect, language, brio and... emotion. It's like a dream of levitation: you're instantaneously aloft, soaring, banking, doing loop-the-loops and then, when you think you're about to plummet to earth, swooping to a gentle touchdown of not easily described sweetness and sorrow... Exhilarating\" (Vincent Canby, The New York Times).",

            "description": "The theory of architecture implicit in our world today, Christopher Alexander believes, is bankrupt. More and more people are aware that something is deeply wrong. Yet the power of present-day ideas is so great that many feel uncomfortable, even afraid, to say openly that they dislike what is happening, because they are afraid to seem foolish, afraid perhaps that they will be laughed at.Now, at last, there is a coherent theory which describes in modern terms an architecture as ancient as human society itself.The Timeless Way of Building is the introductory volume in the Center for Environmental Structure series, Christopher Alexander presents in it a new theory of architecture, building, and planning which has at its core that age-old process by which the people of a society have always pulled the order of their world from their own being.Alexander writes, \"There is one timeless way of building. It is thousands of years old, and the same today as it has always been. The great traditional buildings of the past, the villages and tents and temples in which man feels at home, have always been made by people who were very close to the center of this way. And as you will see, this way will lead anyone who looks for it to buildings which are themselves as ancient in their form as the trees and hills, and as our faces are.\"",

            "description": "Reginald Jeeves, usually referred to as just Jeeves, is a fictional character in a series of comedic short stories and novels by English author P. G. Wodehouse. Jeeves is the highly competent valet of a wealthy and idle young Londoner named Bertie Wooster. First appearing in print in 1915, Jeeves continued to feature in Wodehouse's work until his last completed novel Aunts Aren't Gentlemen in 1974, a span of 60 years.Both the name \"Jeeves\" and the character of Jeeves have come to be thought of as the quintessential name and nature of a valet or butler, inspiring many similar characters (as well as the name of the Internet search engine Ask Jeeves, now simply called Ask.com). A \"Jeeves\" is now a generic term as validated by its entry in the Oxford English Dictionary.Jeeves is a valet, not a butler; that is, he is responsible for serving an individual, whereas a butler is responsible for a household and manages other servants. On rare occasions he fills in for someone else's butler. According to Bertie Wooster, he \"can buttle with the best of them.\"",

Thomas Wolfe wrote standing up in the kitchen, the top of the refrigerator as his desk, dreamily fondling his \u201cmale configurations\u201d. . . Jean-Paul Sartre chewed on Corydrane tablets (a mix of amphetamine and aspirin), ingesting ten times the recommended dose each day . . . Descartes liked to linger in bed, his mind wandering in sleep through woods, gardens, and enchanted palaces where he experienced \u201cevery pleasure imaginable.\u201d",

            "description": "You\u2019ve almost certainly laughed at Scovell\u2019s jokes\u2014you just didn\u2019t know it until now.\u200dJust the Funny Parts is a juicy and scathingly funny insider look at how pop culture gets made. For more than thirty years, writer, producer and director Nell Scovell worked behind the scenes of iconic TV shows, including The Simpsons, Late Night with David Letterman, Murphy Brown,NCIS,The Muppets, and Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, which she created and executive produced. \u00a0In 2009, Scovell gave up her behind-the-scenes status when the David Letterman sex scandal broke. Only the second woman ever to write for his show, Scovell used the moment to publicly call out the lack of gender diversity in late-night TV writers\u2019 rooms. \u201cOne of the boys\u201d came out hard for \u201call of the girls.\u201d Her criticisms fueled a cultural debate. Two years later, Scovell was collaborating with Sheryl Sandberg on speeches and later on Lean In, which resulted in a worldwide movement.Now Scovell is opening up with this fun, honest, and often shocking account. Scovell knows what it\u2019s like to put words in the mouths of President Barack Obama, Mark Harmon, Candice Bergen, Bob Newhart, Conan O\u2019Brien, Alyssa Milano, and Kermit the Frog, among many others. Through her eyes, you\u2019ll sit in the Simpson writers\u2019 room\u2026 stand on the Oscar red carpet\u2026 pin a tail on Miss Piggy\u2026bond with Star Trek\u2019s Leonard Nimoy\u2026 and experience a Stephen King-like encounter with Stephen King.\u200dJust the Funny Parts is a fast-paced account of a nerdy girl from New England who fought her way to the top of the highly-competitive, male-dominated entertainment field. The book delivers invaluable insights into the creative process and tricks for navigating a difficult workplace. It's part memoir, part how-to, and part survival story. Or, as Scovell puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s like Unbroken, but funnier and with slightly less torture.\u201d",

A cautionary tale about the fragility of democracy, it is an alarming, eerily timeless look at how fascism could take hold in America.Written during the Great Depression, when the country was largely oblivious to Hitler\u2019s aggression, it juxtaposes sharp political satire with the chillingly realistic rise of a president who becomes a dictator to save the nation from welfare cheats, sex, crime, and a liberal press.Called \u201ca message to thinking Americans\u201d by the Springfield Republican when it was published in 1935, It Can\u2019t Happen Here is a shockingly prescient novel that remains as fresh and contemporary as today\u2019s news.With an Introduction by Michael Meyerand an Afterword by Gary Scharnhorst",

In subsequent editions, Whitman continued to revise and expand his poems--but none matched the raw power and immediacy of the first edition. This beautifully designed volume presents the 1855 \"Leaves of Grass\" in its entirety, unchanged, along with Ralph Waldo Emerson's famous letter to Whitman.",

            "description": "This is a book about how we see: the environment around us (its surfaces, their layout, and their colors and textures); where we are in the environment; whether or not we are moving and, if we are, where we are going; what things are good for; how to do things (to thread a needle or drive an automobile); or why things look as they do.The basic assumption is that vision depends on the eye which is connected to the brain. The author suggests that natural vision depends on the eyes in the head on a body supported by the ground, the brain being only the central organ of a complete visual system. When no constraints are put on the visual system, people look around, walk up to something interesting and move around it so as to see it from all sides, and go from one vista to another. That is natural vision -- and what this book is about.",

Featuring more than thirty-five of his projects, it reveals his philosophy of graphic design\u2014how to use it to sell things, explain things, make things look better, make people laugh, make people cry, and (every once in a while) change the world. Specially chosen to illustrate the breadth and reach of graphic design today, each entry demonstrates Bierut\u2019s eclectic approach. In his entertaining voice, the artist walks us through each from start to finish, mixing historic images, preliminary drawings (including full-size reproductions of the notebooks he has maintained for more than thirty-five years), working models and rejected alternatives, as well as the finished work. Throughout, he provides insights into the creative process, his working life, his relationship with clients, and the struggles that any design professional faces in bringing innovative ideas to the world.Offering insight and inspiration for artists, designers, students, and anyone interested in how words, images, and ideas can be put together, How to provides insight to the design process of one of this century\u2019s most renowned creative minds.",

            "description": "Where the Sidewalk Ends turns forty! Celebrate with this anniversary edition that features an eye-catching commemorative red sticker. This classic poetry collection, which is both outrageously funny and profound, has been the most beloved of Shel Silverstein's poetry books for generations.Where the sidewalk ends, Shel Silverstein's world begins. There you'll meet a boy who turns into a TV set and a girl who eats a whale. The Unicorn and the Bloath live there, and so does Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout who will not take the garbage out. It is a place where you wash your shadow and plant diamond gardens, a place where shoes fly, sisters are auctioned off, and crocodiles go to the dentist.Shel Silverstein's masterful collection of poems and drawings is one of Parent & Child magazine's 100 Greatest Books for Kids. School Library Journal said, \"Silverstein has an excellent sense of rhythm and rhyme and a good ear for alliteration and assonance that make these poems a pleasure to read aloud.\"Shel Silverstein's incomparable career as a children's book author and illustrator began with Lafcadio, the Lion Who Shot Back. In 1964, Shel's creativity continued to flourish as four more books were published in the same year\u2014Don't Bump the Glump!, A Giraffe and a Half, Who Wants a Cheap Rhinoceros?, and the beloved classic The Giving Tree. Later he continued to build his remarkable body of work with Where the Sidewalk Ends, A Light in the Attic, Falling Up, Every Thing On It, The Missing Piece, The Missing Piece Meets the Big O, and Runny Babbit.",

Beautiful Evidence is about how seeing turns into showing, how data and evidence turn into explanation. The book identifies excellent and effective methods for showing nearly every kind of information, suggests many new designs (including sparklines), and provides analytical tools for assessing the credibility of evidence presentations (which are seen from both sides: how to produce and how to consume presentations). For alert consumers of presentations, there are chapters on diagnosing evidence corruption and PowerPoint pitches.\u200dBeautiful Evidence concludes with two chapters that leave the world of pixel and paper flatland representations - and move onto seeing and thinking in space land, the real-land of three-space and time.",

            "description": "Women in Clothes is a book unlike any other. It is essentially a conversation among hundreds of women of all nationalities\u2014famous, anonymous, religious, secular, married, single, young, old\u2014on the subject of clothing, and how the garments we put on every day define and shape our lives.It began with a survey. The editors composed a list of more than fifty questions designed to prompt women to think more deeply about their personal style. Writers, activists, and artists including Cindy Sherman, Kim Gordon, Kalpona Akter, Sarah Nicole Prickett, Tavi Gevinson, Miranda July, Roxane Gay, Lena Dunham, and Molly Ringwald answered these questions with photographs, interviews, personal testimonies, and illustrations.Even our most basic clothing choices can give us confidence, show the connection between our appearance and our habits of mind, express our values and our politics, bond us with our friends, or function as armor or disguise. They are the tools we use to reinvent ourselves and to transform how others see us. Women in Clothes embraces the complexity of women\u2019s style decisions, revealing the sometimes funny, sometimes strange, always thoughtful impulses that influence our daily ritual of getting dressed.",

            "description": "Why would a smart New York investment banker pay $12 million for the decaying, stuffed carcass of a shark? By what alchemy does Jackson Pollock\u2019s drip painting No. 5, 1948 sell for $140 million?Intriguing and entertaining, The $12 Million Stuffed Shark is a Freakonomics approach to the economics and psychology of the contemporary art world. Why were record prices achieved at auction for works by 131 contemporary artists in 2006 alone, with astonishing new heights reached in 2007? Don Thompson explores the money, lust, and self-aggrandizement of the art world in an attempt to determine what makes a particular work valuable while others are ignored.This book is the first to look at the economics and the marketing strategies that enable the modern art market to generate such astronomical prices. Drawing on \u00a0interviews with both past and present executives of auction houses and art dealerships, artists, and the buyers who move the market, Thompson launches the reader on a journey of discovery through the peculiar world of modern art. Surprising, passionate, gossipy, revelatory, The $12 Million Stuffed Shark reveals a great deal that even experienced \u00a0auction purchasers do not know.",

            "description": "Scott McCloud tore down the wall between high and low culture in 1993 with Understanding Comics, a massive comic book about comics, linking the medium to such diverse fields as media theory, movie criticism, and web design. In Reinventing Comics, McCloud took this to the next level, charting twelve different revolutions in how comics are generated, read, and perceived today.Now, in Making Comics, McCloud focuses his analysis on the art form itself, exploring the creation of comics, from the broadest principles to the sharpest details (like how to accentuate a character's facial muscles in order to form the emotion of disgust rather than the emotion of surprise.) And he does all of it in his inimitable voice and through his cartoon stand\u2013in narrator, mixing dry humor and legitimate instruction. McCloud shows his reader how to master the human condition through word and image in a brilliantly minimalistic way. Both comic book devotees and the uninitiated will marvel at this journey into a once\u2013underappreciated art form.",

            "description": "In 1903, a student at a military academy sent some of his verses to a well-known Austrian poet, requesting an assessment of their value. The older artist, Rainer Maria Rilke (1875\u20131926), replied to the novice in this series of letters \u2014 an amazing archive of remarkable insights into the ideas behind Rilke's greatest poetry. The ten letters reproduced here were written during an important stage in Rilke's artistic development, and they contain many of the themes that later appeared in his best works. The poet himself afterwards stated that his letters contained part of his creative genius, making this volume essential reading for scholars, poetry lovers, and anyone with an interest in Rilke, German poetry, or the creative impulse.",

            "description": "Hailed by The Washington Post as \"a definitive synthesis of the best editions\" and by The Times of London as \"a monument to Shakespearean scholarship,\" The Oxford Shakespeare is the ultimate anthology of the Bard's work: the most authoritative edition of the plays and poems ever published.Now, almost two decades after the original volume, Oxford is proud to announce a thoroughly updated second edition, including for the first time the texts of The Reign of Edward III and Sir Thomas More, recognizing these two plays officially as authentic works by Shakespeare. This beautiful collection is the product of years of full-time research by a team of British and American scholars and represents the most thorough examination ever undertaken of the nature and authority of Shakespeare's work. The editors reconsidered every detail of the text in the light of modern scholarship and they thoroughly re-examined the earliest printed versions of the plays, firmly establishing the canon and chronological order of composition. All stage directions have been reconsidered in light of original staging, and many new directions for essential action have been added. This superb volume also features a brief introduction to each work as well as an illuminating General Introduction. Finally, the editors have added a wealth of secondary material, including an essay on language, a list of contemporary allusions to Shakespeare, an index of Shakespearean characters, a glossary, a consolidated bibliography, and an index of first lines of the Sonnets.Compiled by the world's leading authorities, packed with information, and attractively designed, The Oxford Shakespeare is the gold standard of Shakespearean anthologies.",

            "description": "Award-winning poet Danez Smith is a groundbreaking force, celebrated for deft lyrics, urgent subjects, and performative power. Don't Call Us Dead opens with a heartrending sequence that imagines an afterlife for black men shot by police, a place where suspicion, violence, and grief are forgotten and replaced with the safety, love, and longevity they deserved here on earth. Smith turns then to desire, mortality the dangers experienced in skin and body and blood and a diagnosis of HIV positive. \"Some of us are killed / in pieces,\" Smith writes, some of us all at once. Don't Call Us Dead is an astonishing and ambitious collection, one that confronts, praises, and rebukes America--\"Dear White America\"--where every day is too often a funeral and not often enough a miracle.",

Subsequently seized by U.S. customs and the San Francisco police, it was the subject of a long court trail at which a series of poets and professors persuaded the court that the book was not obscene. Howl & Other Poems is the single most influential poetic work of the post-World War II era, with over 1,000,000 copies now in print.\"Howl was Allen's metamorphosis from quiet, brilliant, burning bohemian scholar trapped by his flames and repressions to epic vocal bard.\"\u2014Michael McClure\"It is the poet, Allen Ginsberg, who has gone, in his own body, through the horrifying experiences described from life in these pages.\" \u2014William Carlos Williams\"At the height of his bardic powers, Allen Ginsberg could terrify the authorities with the mere utterance of the syllable \u201com\u201d as he led street throngs of citizens protesting the Vietnam War. Ginsberg reigned as the raucous poet of American hippiedom and as a literary pioneer whose freewheeling masterwork \u201cHowl\u201d prevailed against government censorship in a landmark obscenity trial 50 years ago.\" \u2014 New York Times\"Fifty years ago, on October 3, Judge Clayton Horn ruled that Allen Ginsberg's great epic Beat-era poem HOWL was not obscene but instead, a work of literary and social merit. This ruling allowed for the publication of HOWL and exonerated the poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti, who faced jail time and a fine 50 years ago for publishing HOWL.\" \u2014 Pacifica.orgAllen Ginsberg was born June 3, 1926, the son of Naomi Ginsberg, Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9, and Louis Ginsberg, lyric poet and schoolteacher, in Paterson, New Jersey. To these facts Ginsberg adds: \"High school in Paterson till 17, Columbia College, merchant marine, Texas and Denver copyboy, Times Square, amigos in jail, dishwashing, book reviews, Mexico City, market research, Satori in Harlem, Yucatan and Chiapas 1954, West Coast 3 years. Later Arctic Sea trip, Tangier, Venice, Amsterdam, Paris, read at Oxford Harvard Columbia Chicago, quit, wrote Kaddish 1959, made tape to leave behind & fade in Orient awhile. Carl Solomon to whom Howl is addressed, is a intuitive Bronx dadaist and prose-poet.\"",

It is his only major work on typography and remains indispensable for anyone interested in the art of letter forms and the presentation of graphic information.This manifesto, however, is not only about letters their form, fit, and function but also about man's role in an industrial society. As Gill wrote later, it was his chief object \"to describe two worlds that of industrialism and that of the human workman & to define their limits.\"His thinking about type is still provocative. Here are the seeds of modern advertising unjustified lines, tight word and letter spacing, ample leading. Here, too, is vintage Gill, as polemical as he is practical, as much concerned about the soul of man as the work of man; as much obsessed by the ends as by the means.",

            "description": "This collection of dresses from the inimitable Megan Hess celebrates fashion's finest moments and takes the reader on a decadent romp through fashion history... from the haute to the hot. From the elegant, such as Audrey Hepburn's simple black shift or Princess Di's never-ending wedding gown, to the quirky, such as Bjork's Swan Dress or the Liz Hurley safety-pin dress, to the simply unforgettable - such as Marilyn's famous moment in white in The Seven Year Itch or Madonna's perilous-looking conical bustierre.Megan Hess has spent her career exploring and illustrating fashion. And while fashion is an ever-changing, ever-inspiring beast, there are certain dresses that capture a moment in history, the spirit of a generation and the indefinable energy of a fashion icon. In this book, Hess has collected the most iconic dresses throughout fashion history, and explores why they continue to resonate with audiences and viewers in decades to come.Interspersed with historical anecdotes, famous quotes and scene-setting landscape illustrations which enlighten the reader of the social themes surrounding the fashion moment in question, this book is an elegant and immersive introduction to the moments that shaped fashion - and how fashion, in turn, shaped our lives.",

            "description": "A joy-inducing illustrated book about New York City in the ingenious style of William Steig's classic CDB!\u200dJust as there are few cities as storied and replete with life as New York City, there are few illustrators or writers who have charmed as many generations as William Steig. To Molly Young and Joana Avillez, a connection between the two seemed obvious, and so D C-T! (\"The City!\") was born.Using a playful phonetic language first invented by Steig in his now classic 1968 book CDB!--but which in today's world of text message and internet shorthand feels uncannily contemporary--Young and Avillez tell a different story on each page of this collection of illustrations stuffed to brim with humor and cleverness:\"S L-I-F!\" (It's alive!) A boy shouts gleefully at a pile of rubbish seething with rats\"I M B-Z\" (I'm busy) Declares the phone-wielding businesswoman to the would-be mugger\"R U I?\" (Are you high?) Asks the clerk at a bodega to the blissed out shopperBrought to life in Avillez's distinctively ebullient and droll style are precocious pets and pet-owners, iconic architecture, and startlingly intrepid anthropomorphic rats. At once recognizable, and imagined like never before, are the surprising, intoxicating, and not-always-entirely-welcome sights, sounds, and smells of New York City.Full of wit, romance, and sheer delight, D C-T! is both an affectionate portrait of the visual cornucopia that is New York City and a gracious love letter to the great William Steig, sure to enchant readers young and old alike just as his work has for half a century.",

Disguised among the normal citizens of modern-day New York, these magical characters have created their own peaceful and secret society within an exclusive luxury apartment building called Fabletown. But when Snow White's party-girl sister, Rose Red, is apparently murdered, it is up to Fabletown's sheriff, a reformed and pardoned Big Bad Wolf (Bigby Wolf), to determine if the killer is Bluebeard, Rose's ex-lover and notorious wife killer, or Jack, her current live-in boyfriend and former beanstalk-climber.",

            "description": "A man disappears. The woman who loves him is left scarred and haunted. In her fierce, one-of-a-kind debut, Rebecca Lindenberg tells the story\u2014in verse\u2014of her passionate relationship with Craig Arnold, a much-respected poet who disappeared in 2009 while hiking a volcano in Japan. Lindenberg\u2019s billowing, I-contain-multitudes style lays bare the poet\u2019s sadnesses, joys, and longings in poems that are lyric and narrative, at once plainspoken and musically elaborate.Regarding her role in Arnold\u2019s story, Lindenberg writes with clear-eyed humility and endearing dignity: \u201cThe girl with the ink-stained teeth / knows she\u2019s famous / in a tiny, tragic way. / She\u2019s not / daft, after all.\u201d And then later, playfully, of her travels in Italy with the poet, her lover: \u201cThe carabinieri / wanted to know if there were bears / in our part of America. Yes, we said, / many bears. Man-eating bears? Yes, of course, / many man-eating bears.\u201d Every poem in this collection bursts with humor, pathos, verve\u2014and an utterly unique, soulful voice.This widely anticipated debut, already selected as a finalist for several prominent book awards, marks the first collection in the newly minted McSweeney\u2019s Poetry Series. MPS is an imprint which seeks to publish a broad range of excellent new poetry collections in exquisitely designed hardcovers\u2014poetry that\u2019s useful and meaningful to anyone in any walk of life.",

            "description": "Creativity and innovation are widely recognized as essential to success in business, and so many aspects of our lives. For over two decades, Cirque du Soleil has been a world-renowned laboratory of creativity, enthralling audiences around the world by fusing dazzling acrobatics, staging and choreography, and music, along with beautiful costumes and technical effects to inspire and create magical, almost otherworldly theatrical experiences. In The Spark, Cirque's former president of creative content, Lyn Heward, invites readers inside the world and ideas of Cirque du Soleil through the story of an ordinary man searching for meaning in his work and life.Like so many other people in their careers, sports agent Frank Castle has lost the passion he once had for his job. But a chance encounter with an inspiring Cirque du Soleil director takes him inside Cirque du Soleil to meet the artists, directors, designers, and technicians who create, shape, and perform in their acclaimed shows. As the story unfolds, the artists reveal surprising secrets about the sparks that ignite their creativity \u2014 from the pressure of deadlines and the exhilaration that comes from risking it all, to the chance encounters and everyday occurrences that have changed the way they live and work. As Frank comes to discover, every one of us is creative \u2014 wherever we work or whatever our job title is \u2014 but it\u2019s up to us to tap into that powerful force.As The Spark makes clear, there is no single formula for creative success\u2013each of us must unlock the power of our imagination in our own way. An inspiring tale that draws on behind-the-scenes stories from the most creative people in entertainment as well as some out-of-this-world Cirque du Soleil magic, The Spark is an unparalleled guide on how to make creativity a part of everything you do.Lyn Heward is the former President and COO of Cirque du Soleil\u2019s Creative Content Division and is currently acting as executive producer for a variety of special projects. John U. Bacon, a veteran journalist and public speaker, has won numerous national writing awards and is the author of three books.",

            "description": "One of the most important and popular American poets of the 20th century, E. E. Cummings is best known for his brilliant and innovative verse and its distinctive lack of uppercase letters and conventional grammar. He was also a Cubist painter and a World War I veteran. At the age of 23, he abandoned his artistic pursuits for voluntary service as an ambulance driver in France. His military career culminated in a comedy of errors leading to his arrest and imprisonment for treason, as he memorably recounts in The Enormous Room. Cummings transforms a tale of unjust incarceration into a high-energy romp and a celebration of the indomitable human spirit that ranks with the best of its contemporaries, including the works of Hemingway and Dos Passos.The Enormous Room is a 1922 autobiographical novel by the poet and novelist E. E. Cummings about his temporary imprisonment in France during World War I. Cummings served as an ambulance driver during the war. In late August 1917 his friend and colleague, William Slater Brown, were arrested by French authorities as a result of anti-war sentiments B. had expressed in some letters. When questioned, Cummings stood by his friend and was also arrested.",

            "description": "Arguably the most influential, imaginative, and provocative designer of his generation, Alexander McQueen both challenged and expanded fashion conventions to express ideas about race, class, sexuality, religion, and the environment. Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty examines the full breadth of the designer\u2019s career, from the start of his fledgling label to the triumphs of his own world-renowned London house. It features his most iconic and radical designs, revealing how McQueen adapted and combined the fundamentals of Savile Row tailoring, the specialized techniques of haute couture, and technological innovation to achieve his distinctive aesthetic. It also focuses on the highly sophisticated narrative structures underpinning his collections and extravagant runway presentations, with their echoes of avant-garde installation and performance art.Published to coincide with an exhibition at The Metropolitan Museum of Art organized by The Costume Institute, this stunning book includes a preface by Andrew Bolton; an introduction by Susannah Frankel; an interview by Tim Blanks with Sarah Burton, creative director of the house of Alexander McQueen; illuminating quotes from the designer himself; provocative and captivating new photography by renowned photographer S\u00f8lve Sundsb\u00f8; and a lenticular cover by Gary James McQueen.Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty celebrates the astounding creativity and originality of a designer who relentlessly questioned and confronted the requisites of fashion.",

            "description": "Good Hope Road is one of those rare books of verse that combine lyricism with the momentum of narrative, a concern for dailiness with a willingness to embrace wildness. Like Joyce\u2019s Dubliners, the twelve poems of the opening sequence, \u201cApartments,\u201d reflect a wide panorama of contemporary urban consciousness. Dischell\u2019s subjects are wronged lovers, thwarted citizens, an idealistic veteran, bickering relations\u2015all with their entangled, fractious alliances. In \u201cHousehold Gods,\u201d the book\u2019s second section, Dischell presents dramatic monologues whose scenes are the shore, the city, and the countryside. Here are homages and elegies; poems of childhood, betrayal, and loss. Observant and compassionate, this edition of Good Hope Road reintroduces the work of a striking and powerful writer.",

            "description": "Drawing from his own experience and the lives of some of the world's great writers and poets, David Whyte brings compelling insights to our three most important commitments\u2014to another, to our work, and to ourselves\u2014to frame a complete picture of a satisfying life.David Whyte knows there are three crucial relationships, or marriages, in our lives: the marriage or partnership with a significant other, the commitment we have to our work, and the vows, spoken or unspoken, we make to an inner, constantly developing self. In The Three Marriages, the bestselling author, poet, and speaker argues that it is not possible to sacrifice one relationship for the others without causing deep psychological damage. Too often, he says, we fracture our lives and split our energies foolishly, so that one or more of these marriages is sacrificed and may wither and die, in the process impoverishing them all. Whyte looks to a different way of seeing and connecting these relationships and prompts us to examine each marriage with a fierce but affectionate eye as he shows us the importance of cherishing all three equally.Drawing from his own struggles to achieve this goal as well as exploring the lives of some of the world's great writers and activists\u2014from Dante to Joan of Arc, from Austen to Dickinson\u2014Whyte reveals that our core commitments are irrevocably connected. Only by understanding the simultaneously robust and delicate nature of the three marriages and the stages of their maturation, he maintains, can we create a real portrait of what makes us tick and a real sense of finding a place in the world.In prose that's at once lyrical and inviting, Whyte investigates captivating ideas for bringing a deeper satisfaction to our lives, one that goes beyond our previously held ideas of balance.",

            "description": "The definitive biography of David Letterman, the greatest television talk show host of all time and the hallmark humorous voice of a generation, is written by New York Times comedy writer Jason Zinoman.David Letterman created the contemporary talk show with a sarcastic humorous style that transcended traditional television over the course of a thirty-year career. While he is still one of America's most well-known figures, he is a distant, almost secretive figure whose career is largely misunderstood. Letterman combines groundbreaking reporting with unprecedented access and probing critical analysis to explain the unique entertainer's titanic legacy. Jason Zinoman, the first comedy critic in the history of the New York Times, combines groundbreaking reporting with unprecedented access and probing critical analysis to explain the unique entertainer's titanic legacy. Zinoman takes us behind the scenes of Letterman's television career, from his early days in Indiana to his retirement, to expose the beginnings of his groundbreaking humour, its missed inspirations, and how his work connects with and reflects his notoriously quirky nature.Letterman, according to Zinoman, had three major artistic eras, each different and integral to his development. He illuminates Letterman's relationship with his writers, particularly the show's co-creator, Merrill Markoe, with whom Letterman shared a long professional and personal relationship, as he examines key broadcasting moments such as \"Stupid Pet Tricks\" and other captivating segments that defined Late Night with David Letterman.To understand popular culture today, it\u2019s necessary to understand David Letterman. With this revealing biography, Zinoman offers a perceptive analysis of the man and the artist whose ironic voice and caustic meta-humor was critical to an entire generation of comedians and viewers\u2014and whose singular style ushered in new tropes that have become clich\u00e9s in comedy today.",

Now, acclaimed biographer David Michaelis gives us the first full-length biography of the brilliant, unseen man behind Peanuts: at once a creation story, a portrait of a native genius, and a chronicle contrasting the private man with the central role he played in shaping the national imagination. Schulz and Peanuts is the definitive epic biography of an American icon and the unforgettable characters he created.",

Keep Creating.In his previous books Steal Like an Artist and Show Your Work!, both New York Times bestsellers, Austin Kleon gave readers the keys to unlock their creativity and showed them how to become known. Now he offers his most inspiring work yet, with ten simple rules for how to stay creative, focused, and true to yourself\u2014for life.The creative life is not a linear journey to a finish line, it\u2019s a loop\u2014so find a daily routine, because today is the only day that matters. Disconnect from the world to connect with yourself\u2014sometimes you just have to switch into airplane mode. Keep Going celebrates getting outdoors and taking a walk (as director Ingmar Bergman told his daughter, \u201dThe demons hate fresh air\u201d). Pay attention, and especially pay attention to what you pay attention to. Worry less about getting things done, and more about the worth of what you\u2019re doing. Instead of focusing on making your mark, work to leave things better than you found them.\u200dKeep Going and its timeless, practical, and ethical principles are for anyone trying to sustain a meaningful and productive life.",

            "description": "Eighty-six-year-old Betty Halbreich is a true original. A tough broad who could have stepped straight out of Stephen Sondheim\u2019s repertoire, she has spent nearly forty years as the legendary personal shopper at Bergdorf Goodman, where she works with socialites, stars, and ordinary women off the street. She has helped many find their true selves through clothes, frank advice, and her own brand of wisdom. She is trusted by the most discriminating persons\u2014including Hollywood\u2019s top stylists\u2014to tell them what looks best. But Halbreich\u2019s personal transformation from a cosseted young girl to a fearless truth teller is the greatest makeover of her career.A Chicago native, Halbreich moved to Manhattan at twenty after marrying the dashing Sonny Halbreich, a true character right out of Damon Runyon who liked the nightlife of New York in the fifties. On the surface, they were a great match, but looks can be deceiving; an unfaithful Sonny was emotionally distant while Halbreich became increasingly anguished. After two decades, the fraying marriage finally came undone. Bereft without Sonny and her identity as his wife, she hit rock bottom.After she began the frightening process of reclaiming herself and started therapy, Halbreich was offered a lifeline in the form of a job at the legendary luxury store Bergdorf Goodman. Soon, she was asked to run the store\u2019s first personal shopping service. It was a perfect fit.Meticulous, impeccable, hardworking, elegant, and\u2014most of all\u2014delightfully funny, Halbreich has never been afraid to tell it to her clients straight. She won\u2019t sell something just to sell it. If an outfit or shoe or purse is too expensive, she\u2019ll dissuade you from buying it. As Halbreich says, \u201cThere are two things nobody wants to face: their closet and their mirror.\u201d She helps women do both, every day.",

It is aimed at design students and graphic designers, and also at those who are concerned with content: writers, editors, and publishers. Showing a wide range of examples from first-rate designers across the world, the book examines why and how typographic designs work well in a given context. Particular attention is given to the team play between the text itself\u2014written language\u2014and the design\u2014the shaping of the text\u2014to form a new, multilevel visual message with a complex content.",

            "description": "An aphorism is \"a short pithy statement or maxim,\" but beneath this definition lies a wealth of wit and insight to which neither the word nor a brief description can do justice. This anthology demonstrates just how rewarding an art form the aphorism can be, and just how brilliantly the aphorist can illuminate the hidden truth, or lay bare the ironies of existence. Specific sections on desires and longings, self-doubt, fame and reputations, happiness and sorrow, cover the whole range of aphoristic literature. This book brings together the most diverse figures-the classic aphorists, like La Rochefoucauld; the philosophers, from the Greeks to Samuel Johnson to Virginia Woolf-as well as statesmen, scientists, boulevardiers, Olympians, and gadflies. John Gross draws on their wisdom and wit to produce an anthology that will be referred to time and time again.",

            "description": "Tom Taylor's life was screwed from go. His father created the Tommy Taylor fantasy series, boy-wizard novels with popularity on par with Harry Potter. The problem is Dad modeled the fictional epic so closely to Tom's real life that fans are constantly comparing him to his counterpart, turning him into the lamest variety of Z-level celebrity. In the final novel, it's even implied that the fictional Tommy will crossover into the real world, giving delusional fans more excuses to harass Tom.When an enormous scandal reveals that Tom might really be a boy-wizard made flesh, Tom comes into contact with a very mysterious, very deadly group that's secretly kept tabs on him all his life. Now, to protect his own life and discover the truth behind his origins, Tom will travel the world, eventually finding himself at locations all featured on a very special map -- one kept by the deadly group that charts places throughout world history where fictions have impacted and tangibly shaped reality, those stories ranging from famous literary works to folktales to pop culture. And in the process of figuring out what it all means, Tom will find himself having to figure out a huge conspiracy mystery that spans the entirety of the history of fiction.",

This text has been used with success at every level of higher education, in all disciplines, wherever extensive writing is required. An accompanying 30-minute Revising Prose Video, as well as a Set of Interactive Revision Exercises, are available from Rhetorica, Inc. for an additional fee.",

            "description": "A collection of poignant, perceptive essays that expertly blends the personal and political in an exploration of American culture through the lens of our obsession with dead women.In her debut collection, Alice Bolin turns a critical eye to literature and pop culture, the way media consumption reflects American society, and her own place within it. From essays on Joan Didion and James Baldwin to Twin Peaks, Britney Spears, and Serial, Bolin illuminates our widespread obsession with women who are abused, killed, and disenfranchised, and whose bodies (dead and alive) are used as props to bolster a man\u2019s story.From chronicling life in Los Angeles to dissecting the \u201cDead Girl Show\u201d to analyzing literary witches and werewolves, this collection challenges the narratives we create and tell ourselves, delving into the hazards of toxic masculinity and those of white womanhood. Beginning with the problem of dead women in fiction, it expands to the larger problems of living women\u2014both the persistent injustices they suffer and the oppression that white women help perpetrate.Sharp, incisive, and revelatory, Dead Girls is a much-needed dialogue on women\u2019s role in the media and in our culture.",

            "description": "A survey of the world's major scripts, studied through sight, sound and symbol.Andrew Robinson explains the interconnection between sound, symbol, and script in a succinct and absorbing text. He discusses each of the major writing systems in turn, from cuneiform and Egyptian and Mayan hieroglyphs to alphabets and the scripts of China and Japan, as well as topics such as the Cherokee \u201calphabet\u201d and the writing of runes. Full coverage is given to the history of decipherment, and a provocative chapter devoted to undeciphered scripts challenges the reader: can these codes ever be broken? In this revised edition, the author reveals the latest discoveries to have an impact on our knowledge of the history of writing, including the Tabula Cortonensis showing Etruscan symbols and a third millennium BC seal from Turkmenistan that could solve the mystery of how Chinese writing evolved. He also discusses how the digital revolution has not, despite gloomy predictions, spelled doom for the printed book. In addition, the table of Maya glyphs has been revised so that they are up-to-date with current research.",

Smoking, Europe, and drunk driving are among the causes championed. It's a masterpiece.",

Examining questions of faith, desire and enlightenment, the poem is a brilliantly nuanced and moving allegory of human redemption.Dante Alighieri was born in Florence in 1265 and belonged to a noble but impoverished family. His life was divided by political duties and poetry, the most of famous of which was inspired by his meeting with Bice Portinari, whom he called Beatrice,including La Vita Nuova and The Divine Comedy. He died in Ravenna in 1321.",

More than a guide to visual appreciation, this is a book about how to recognize, evaluate, and understand the objects and landscape of the man-made world. The pursuit of design is not about the way things appear, but rather about the way things give meaning and relevance to the human experience.",

After all, art is rarely made by Mozart-like people; essentially-statistically speaking-there aren't any people like that. Geniuses get made once-a-century or so, yet good art gets made all the time, so to equate the making of art with the workings of genius removes this intimately human activity to a strangely unreachable and unknowable place. For all practical purposes making art can be examined in great detail without ever getting entangled in the very remote problems of genius.",

            "description": "In 1951, designer Greta Magnusson Grossman observed that California design was \"not a superimposed style, but an answer to present conditions.... It has developed out of our own preferences for living in a modern way.\" California design influenced the material culture of the entire country, in everything from architecture to fashion. This generously illustrated book, which accompanies a major exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, is the first comprehensive examination of California's mid-century modern design. It begins by tracing the origins of a distinctively California modernism in the 1930s by such European \u00e9migr\u00e9s as Richard Neutra, Rudolph Schindler, and Kem Weber; it finds other specific design influences and innovations in solid-color commercial ceramics, inspirations from Mexico and Asia, new schools for design training, new concepts about leisure, and the conversion of wartime technologies to peacetime use (exemplified by Charles and Ray Eames's plywood and fiberglass furniture).The heart of California Design is the modern California home, famously characterized by open plans conducive to outdoor living. The layouts of modernist homes by Pierre Koenig, Craig Ellwood, and Raphael Soriano, for example, were intended to blur the distinction between indoors and out. Homes were furnished with products from Heath Ceramics, Van Keppel-Green, and Architectural Pottery as well as other, previously unheralded companies and designers. Many objects were designed to be multifunctional: pool and patio furniture that was equally suitable indoors, lighting that was both task and ambient, bookshelves that served as room dividers, and bathing suits that would turn into ensembles appropriate for indoor entertainment. California Design includes 350 images, most in color, of furniture, ceramics, metalwork, architecture, graphic and industrial design, film, textiles, and fashion, and ten incisive essays that trace the rise of the California design aesthetic.",

Even if you sometimes think you aren\u2019t! And especially if other people try to tell you you\u2019re not.\u200dIn I Know What I\u2019m Doing\u2014and Other Lies I Tell Myself, Jen offers up all the gory details of a life permanently in progress. She reassures you that it\u2019s okay to not have life completely figured out, even when you reach middle age (and find your first gray pubic hair!). She talks about making unusual or unpopular life decisions (such as cultivating a \u201cfriend with benefits\u201d or not going home for the holidays) because you don\u2019t necessarily want for yourself what everyone else seems to think you should. It\u2019s about renting when everyone says you should own, dating around when everyone thinks you should settle down, and traveling alone when everyone pities you for going to Paris without a man.From marriage to divorce and sex to mental health, I Know What I\u2019m Doing\u2014and Other Lies I Tell Myself is about embracing the fact that life is a bit of a sh*t show and it\u2019s definitely more than okay to stay true to yourself.",

            "description": "The first in-depth, behind-the-scenes book treatment of the rivalry between the two comic book giants.THEY ARE THE TWO TITANS OF THE COMIC BOOK INDUSTRY--the Coke and Pepsi of superheroes--and for more than 50 years, Marvel and DC have been locked in an epic battle for spandex supremacy. At stake is not just sales, but cultural relevancy and the hearts of millions of fans.To many partisans, Marvel is now on top. But for much of the early 20th century, it was DC that was the undisputed leader, having launched the American superhero genre with the 1938 publication of Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegel's Superman strip. DC's titles sold millions of copies every year, and its iconic characters were familiar to nearly everyone in America. Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman--DC had them all.And then in 1961, an upstart company came out of nowhere to smack mighty DC in the chops. With the publication of Fantastic Four #1, Marvel changed the way superheroes stories were done. Writer-editor Stan Lee, artists Jack Kirby, and the talented Marvel bullpen subsequently unleashed a string of dazzling new creations, including the Avengers, Hulk, Spider-Man, the X-Men, and Iron Man.Marvel's rise forever split fandom into two opposing tribes. Suddenly the most telling question you could ask a superhero lover became \"Marvel or DC?\"Slugfest, the first book to chronicle the history of this epic rivalry into a single, in-depth narrative, is the story of the greatest corporate rivalry never told. Complete with interviews with the major names in the industry, Slugfest reveals the arsenal of schemes the two companies have employed in their attempts to outmaneuver the competition, whether it be stealing ideas, poaching employees, planting spies, or launching price wars. The feud has never completely disappeared, and it simmers on a low boil to this day. With DC and Marvel characters becoming global icons worth billions, if anything, the stakes are higher now than ever before.",

It\u2019s the ubiquitous style of dress comprising hoodies, sneakers, and T-shirts. In the beginning, a few brands defined this style; fewer still survived as streetwear went mainstream. They are the OGs, the \u201cheritage brands.\u201d The Hundreds is one of those persevering companies, and Bobby Hundreds is at the center of it all.The creative force behind the brand, Bobby Kim, a.k.a. Bobby Hundreds, has emerged as a prominent face and voice in streetwear. In telling the story of his formative years, he reminds us that The Hundreds was started by outsiders; and this is truly the story of streetwear culture.In This Is Not a T-Shirt, updated with a new introduction by the author plus a new 16-page full-color insert, Bobby Hundreds cements his spot as a champion of an industry he helped create and tells the story of The Hundreds\u2015with anecdotes ranging from his Southern California, punk-DIY-tinged youth to the brand\u2019s explosive success. Both an inspiring memoir and an expert assessment of the history and future of streetwear, this is the tale of Bobby\u2019s commitment to his creative vision and to building a real community.",

            "description": "The Art, Science, and Craft of Great Landscape Photography teaches photographers how to transform their visual peak experiences\u2014moments of amazing natural beauty that generate amazement and wonder\u2014into magnificent photos that elicit the same astonished reaction in their viewers. Whether you want to go into the mountains for once-in-a-lifetime views of raw nature or just practise your landscape photography abilities from the safety of your back porch, Randall discusses the art, science, and craft of generating stunning images.Randall begins by focusing on landscape photography as an art form. He explains his three-step approach to image composition and demonstrates how effective composition is an organic process that starts with rules but eventually transcends them. Randall then delves into the physics underlying great landscape photography, which necessitates a thorough grasp of geology, optics, vision, and psychology. These are some of the ideas:Understanding how the sun's position at sunrise and sunset fluctuates throughout the year will aid you in deciding when and where to photograph. To forecast where rainbows will emerge, how polarizers will interact with reflections, and where to locate stunning light, you'll need to understand optics. Understanding how to utilize topographic maps and computerized mapping tools to locate the best shooting places in the woods is essential. Understanding the psychology of how we interpret art and how our visual system evaluates pictures.These tips can assist you in taking good images. Randall covers the issues of exposure in landscape photography from every perspective, from suggestions on calculating exposures in the field to attaining accurate exposure in high-contrast lighting scenarios to the finest digital darkroom approaches.With practise and the skills described in this book, you can master great landscape photography. The Art, Science, and Craft of Great Landscape Photography is for photographers who have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of photography and are ready to grasp the finer points of generating stunning landscape images.",

William Safire, the author of the New York Times Magazine column \"On Language,\" homes in on the \"essential misrules of grammar,\" those mistakes that call attention to the major rules and regulations of writing. He tells you the correct way to write and then tells you when it is all right to break the rules. In this lighthearted guide, he chooses the most common and perplexing concerns of writers new and old. Each mini-chapter starts by stating a misrule like \"Don't use Capital letters without good REASON.\" Safire then follows up with solid and entertaining advice on language, grammar, and life. He covers a vast territory from capitalization, split infinitives (it turns out you can split one if done meaningfully), run-on sentences, and semi-colons to contractions, the double negative, dangling participles, and even onomatopoeia. Originally published under the title Fumblerules.",

            "description": "Beautiful and determined. Charming and direct. Grace Coddington's exceptional talent and unwavering commitment to her job as Vogue's creative director have made her a global legend. Grace may have remained fashion's best-kept secret for most of her career if it hadn't been for The September Issue, the renowned 2009 documentary that transformed the publicity-averse Grace into a reluctant superstar. Grace's obvious enthusiasm for her profession provided a rare glimpse into the dedication that goes into many of the magazine's most famous photographs.Grace now artistically takes the reader through the legendary tale of her life thus far, using the funny, frank style that has endeared her to her colleagues and peers for more than forty years. Grace discusses her early career as a model, working with world-class photographers like David Bailey and Norman Parkinson before moving behind the camera to become a fashion editor at British Vogue in the late 1960s, evoking the days when models had to carry their own luggage and props to shoots. She began her imaginary \"travelogues\" here, which would become her hallmark. She joined American Vogue in 1988, and her stunningly beautiful and inventive fashion stories, some of which are included in this book, quickly became immediate classics.Grace will expose readers to the colorful designers, hairstylists, makeup artists, photographers, models, and celebrities with whom Grace has created her characteristic photographs, which will be beautifully complemented by Grace's pen-and-ink illustrations. Grace opens up about her personal life, including the automobile accident that nearly ended her modelling career, her two marriages, her sister Rosemary's sudden death, her relationship with Harper's Bazaar editor-in-chief Liz Tilberis, and her thirty-year affair with Didier Malige. Finally, Grace discusses her long-standing friendship with Anna Wintour, as well as the developing skill with which she has come to define fashion's pinnacle.",

            "description": "The Poetic Edda is a treasure trove of legendary and spiritual poem that has a significant influence on Nordic culture, literature, and tradition. Its tales of death and battle serve as a lyrical storehouse of Norse mythology and heroic tradition, encapsulating both the ethical ideals and cultural life of the North in late heathen and early Christian periods.The Poetic Edda was unearthed in Iceland in the seventeenth century by Danish researchers. It was collected by an anonymous Icelander, most likely in the twelfth or thirteenth century. Its worth as poetry, historical knowledge, and a compilation of fascinating anecdotes was recognized even back then. In a version that Scandinavian Studies states \"may easily grace anyone's bookshelves,\" this painstaking translation succeeds in recreating the verse patterns, rhythm, mood, and dignity of the original.",

Throughout his life, Churchill painted to relieve his mind from the demands of leadership\u2014and to stave off depression.Included in this volume are Churchill\u2019s meditations on painting as a salve for the spirit and an important method of relaxation\u2014particularly for people under considerable stress over a long period of time. In addition, it includes 18 reprints of Churchill\u2019s original work in oil, giving the reader a window into the little-known creative and artistic talent of this prominent figure in contemporary history.",

He also talks about New York, America, and his childhood in McKeesport, Pennsylvania; about his good times and bad times in New York, the explosion of his career in the 1960s, and his life among celebrities.\u200d",

It is among mankind\u2019s great masterpieces\u2014a massive work of art. As an idea, it rivals monotheism. We all inhabit this fascinating place. But its deep logic, its cultural potential, and its societal impact often elude us. In this deep and thoughtful book, Virginia Heffernan presents an original and far-reaching analysis of what the Internet is and does.Life online, in the highly visual, social, portable, and global incarnation rewards certain virtues. The new medium favors speed, accuracy, wit, prolificacy, and versatility, and its form and functions are changing how we perceive, experience, and understand the world.",

            "description": "When the low-budget biker movie Easy Rider shocked Hollywood with its success in 1969, a new Hollywood era was born. This was an age when talented young filmmakers such as Scorsese, Coppola, and Spielberg, along with a new breed of actors, including De Niro, Pacino, and Nicholson, became the powerful figures who would make such modern classics as The Godfather, Chinatown, Taxi Driver, and Jaws. Easy Riders, Raging Bulls follows the wild ride that was Hollywood in the '70s -- an unabashed celebration of sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll (both onscreen and off) and a climate where innovation and experimentation reigned supreme. Based on hundreds of interviews with the directors themselves, producers, stars, agents, writers, studio executives, spouses, and ex-spouses, this is the full, candid story of Hollywood's last golden age.",

            "description": "In Vogue is a fascinating look at the history of the world's most influential magazine. The complete compendium is illustrated with hundreds of covers and archival interiors of past Vogue editions, featuring the work of some of the twentieth century's most respected artists, cover illustrators, and photographers\u2014from Edward Steichen, Toni Frissell, and Erwin Blumenfeld to Irving Penn, Richard Avedon, David Bailey, Helmut Newton, Annie Leibovitz, Mario Testino, Steven Klein, Bruce Webber, and Herb Ritts. In 1909, an entrepreneurial New Yorker named Cond\u00e9 Nast took charge of a struggling society journal and transformed it into the most glamorous fashion magazine of the twentieth century. In Vogue traces the history, development and influence of this media colossus\u2014from its beginning as a social gazette in the late nineteenth century, to the exploration of modern fashion photography and new visuals in the mid-twentieth century, to its status as the top style magazine today.The book explains the makings of the magazine\u2014from runways, to editorial meetings, to the pages of Vogue. The thoroughly researched story incorporates first-person accounts, interviews with editors and photographers, and excerpts from stories written in the magazine by many world-renowned writers, including Truman Capote, Aldous Huxley, Richard Burton, Federico Fellini, and Marcello Mastroianni. Unparalleled in its scope and exceptionally illustrated, In Vogue is sure to be among the most important publications on the subjects of culture, art, fashion, photography, and media.",

If you've ever arrived and left a little glazed and confused . . . If you've ever thought, I might read an eight-page article about art museums but not a whole book . . . Then this is your story.Museum LegsA-A---taken from a term for art fatigue--starts with a question: Why do people get bored and tired in art museums and why does that matter? As Whitaker writes in this humorous and incisive collection of essays, museums matter for reasons that have less to do with art as we know it and more to do with business, politics, and the age-old question of how to live.Maybe the great age of museums will yet be a great age of creativity and hopeful possibility in everyday life.",

            "description": "Creativity is not a gift from the gods, says Twyla Tharp, bestowed by some divine and mystical spark. It is the product of preparation and effort, and it's within reach of everyone who wants to achieve it. All it takes is the willingness to make creativity a habit, an integral part of your life: In order to be creative, you have to know how to prepare to be creative. In The Creative Habit, Tharp takes the lessons she has learned in her remarkable thirty-five-year career and shares them with you, whatever creative impulses you follow -- whether you are a painter, composer, writer, director, choreographer, or, for that matter, a businessperson working on a deal, a chef developing a new dish, a mother wanting her child to see the world anew.When Tharp is at a creative dead end, she relies on a lifetime of exercises to help her get out of the rut, and The Creative Habit contains more than thirty of them to ease the fears of anyone facing a blank beginning and to open the mind to new possibilities.Tharp's exercises are practical and immediately doable -- for the novice or expert. In \"Where's Your Pencil?\" she reminds us to observe the world -- and get it down on paper. In \"Coins and Chaos,\" she provides the simplest of mental games to restore order and peace. In \"Do a Verb,\" she turns your mind and body into coworkers. In \"Build a Bridge to the Next Day,\" she shows how to clean your cluttered mind overnight.To Tharp, sustained creativity begins with rituals, self-knowledge, harnessing your memories, and organizing your materials (so no insight is ever lost). Along the way she leads you by the hand through the painful first steps of scratching for ideas, finding the spine of your work, and getting out of ruts into productive grooves. In her creative realm, optimism rules. An empty room, a bare desk, a blank canvas can be energizing, not demoralizing. And in this inventive, encouraging book, Twyla Tharp shows us how to take a deep breath and begin!",

Vamos!\u200dBefore he inspired the world with Hamilton and was catapulted to international fame, Lin-Manuel Miranda was inspiring his Twitter followers with words of encouragement at the beginning and end of each day. He wrote these original sayings, aphorisms, and poetry for himself as much as for others. But as Miranda's audience grew, these messages took on a life on their own. Now Miranda has gathered the best of his daily greetings into a beautiful collection illustrated by acclaimed artist (and fellow Twitter favorite) Jonny Sun.Full of comfort and motivation, Gmorning, Gnight! is a touchstone for anyone who needs a quick lift.",

In her twenty years behind the mic at New York City's two biggest hip-hop stations--Hot 97 and Power 105.1--Angie Martinez has become an entertainment legend. From one-time presidential hopeful Barack Obama to Jay-Z and Beyonce to post-prison Tupac, her intimate and candid interviews with the leading names in the music business, hip-hop culture, and beyond have grabbed headlines and changed the conversation. In the same no-holds-barred style of her radio show, Angie shares stories from behind-the-scenes of her most controversial interviews and reflects on her climb to the top of the radio business. And for the first time, Angie opens up about her personal life, exploring how her experiences have shaped her into the strong and outspoken woman that she is today. The Power of a Voice brings together New York City's one-of-a-kind urban radio culture, the changing faces of hip-hop music, and Angie Martinez's rise to become the Voice of New York\"",

            "description": "With over one hundred photos, Virginia Postrel, a well-known author, distinguishes glamour from glitter, describing what characteristics make a person, an object, a place, or an event beautiful. What causes that pleasurable aching of desire\u2014that \"if only\" sensation? If only I could look like that, join that club, drive that vehicle, live in that house, and be (or be with) that person. Postrel discusses the three fundamental characteristics of glamour and shows how they work together to generate a distinct sensation of projection and desire in all varieties of glamour.The Power of Glamour is the first book to define glamour as a phenomenon that reveals our inner selves and impacts our major and tiny behaviors, rather than merely a fashion trend or a personal feature. Glamour inspires ambition and optimism by evoking the possibility of a new and better self in different and better circumstances, even if it might lead to harmful fantasies.From holiday brochures to military recruitment advertisements, from the Chrysler Building to the iPad, from political utopias to action heroes, Postrel claims that beauty is a powerful cultural force. Its attraction extends beyond the worlds of fashion and film, affecting our purchase decisions as well as where we live, what jobs we pursue, where we invest, and how we vote.The result is a paradigm-shifting concept explaining how glamour developed into a powerful sort of nonverbal persuasion that taps into our deepest wants and secrets to influence our daily decisions.",

            "description": "30 years after its publication Marshall McLuhan's The Medium is the Massage remains his most entertaining, provocative and piquant book.With every technological and social advancement, McLuhan's proclamation that \"the media work us over completely\" becomes more evident and plain. In his words, so pervasive are they in their personal, political, economic, aesthetic, psychological, moral, ethical and social consequences that they leave no part of us untouched, unaffected, or unaltered.McLuhan suggests modern audiences enjoy MainStream media as soothing, enjoyable, and relaxing; however, the pleasure we find in the MainStream media is deceiving, because/as/since the changes between society and technology are incongruent, perpetuating an Age of Anxiety.McLuhan's remarkable observation that \"societies have always been shaped more by the nature of the media by which men communicate than by the content of the communication\" is undoubtedly more relevant today than ever before. With the rise of the internet and the explosion of the digital revolution there has never been a better time to revisit Marshall McLuhan.",

            "description": "From Academy Award nominee, Golden Globe winner, and star of the new motion picture Hidden Figures, Taraji P. Henson, comes an inspiring and funny book about family, friends, the hustle required to make it from DC to Hollywood, and the joy of living in your own truth.With a sensibility that recalls her beloved screen characters, including NASA physicist mathematician Katherine G. Johnson, Yvette, Queenie, Shug, and the iconic Cookie from Empire, yet is all Taraji, the screen actress writes of her family, the one she was born into and the one she created. She shares stories of her father, a Vietnam vet who was bowed but never broken by life's challenges, and of her mother who survived violence both in the home and on DC's volatile streets. Here too she opens up about her experiences as a single mother, a journey some saw as a burden but which she saw as a gift.\u200dAround the Way Girl is also a classic actor\u2019s memoir in which Taraji reflects on the world-class instruction she received at Howard University and the pitfalls that come with being a black actress. With laugh-out-loud humor and candor, she shares the challenges and disappointments of the actor\u2019s journey and shows us that behind the red carpet moments, she is ever authentic. She is at heart just a girl in pursuit of her dreams.",

            "description": "Known during his life primarily as an artist associated with the New York School of poets, Joe Brainard (1942\u20131994) was also a wonderful writer whose one-of-a-kind autobiographical work I Remember (\u201ca completely original book\u201d\u2014Edmund White) has had a wide and growing influence. It is joined in this major new retrospective with many other works that for the first time allow the full range of Brainard\u2019s writing to be savored in all its deadpan wit, nonstop goofy inventiveness, self-revealing frankness, and generosity of spirit. Collected Writings gathers journals, jottings, letters, stories, one-liners, comic books, mini-essays, and playlets, much of which exist in print only in expensive rarities, if at all, to create \u201cone of the most dazzlingly minute autobiographies ever written\u201d (Harper\u2019s Magazine).\u201cBrainard disarms us with the seemingly tossed-off, spontaneous nature of his writing and his stubborn refusal to accede to the pieties of self-importance,\u201d writes Paul Auster in his introduction to this collection. Assembled by the author\u2019s longtime friend and biographer Ron Padgett and including fourteen never-before published works, here is a fresh and affordable way to rediscover a unique American artist.",

            "description": "John Severson (born 1933) revolutionized pop culture's vision of surfing and surf culture through his prolific artistic output that transverses decades and disciplines. He began his career as a painter, selling his canvases at Long Beach State College. These first works consisted of oil paintings, photographs, drawings and prints relating to Hawaiian and Californian surf culture. In 1958, Severson expanded his repertoire and created a series of popular surf movies, such as \"Surf Safari,\" \"Surf Fever,\" \"Big Wednesday\" and \"Pacific Vibrations.\"While his were among the first surf movies, it was the posters associated with them, hugely popular when issued in the 1950s and 1960s, that remain collector favorites today. Showcased in these early posters, his graphic skills translated easily to \"Surfer\" magazine, which he founded in 1960. The magazine was the first to celebrate and revolutionize the art and sport of surfing, establishing it as a powerful pop culture phenomenon. The first issue was a 36-page collection of black-and-white photos, cartoon sketches and short articles--every aspect of which was created by Severson himself. His photographs appeared in \"Life,\" \"Sports Illustrated,\" \"Paris Match\" and other print venues.\"John Severson's SURF\" explores Severson's surf odyssey through painting, photography, film and publishing. Featuring an interview with the artist by Nathan Howe, artist and curator at Puka Puka, Hawaii, foreword by Gerry Lopez, surfer and co-founder of Lightning Bolt surfboards and afterword by Drew Kampion, author and former editor of \"Surfer,\" \"John Severson's SURF\" documents the birth of surf culture and serves as a testament to our ocean.",

In Three Plays By Mae West, Lillian Schlissel brings this underexplored part of West's career to the fore by offering for the first time in book form, three of the plays West wrote in the 1920s--Sex (1926), The Drag (1927) and Pleasure Man (1928). With an insightful introduction by Schlissel, this book offers a unique look into to the life and early career of this legendary stage and screen actress.",

His baffling tricks and stunning illusions have set new standards of what's possible, as well as causing controversy. Now, for the first time, he reveals the secrets behind his craft.He delves into the structure and psychology of magic. He tells you how to read clues in people's behaviour and spot liars. He discusses the whys and wherefores of hypnosis (which he says doesn't exist) and shows how to use the powers of suggestion and massively improve the power of your memory. He also investigates the paranormal industry, exposes a few charlatans and looks at why some of us feel the need to believe in it in the first place... Woven into this are autobiographical stories about Derren's own experiences and beliefs, told with characteristic humour and engaging honesty. This extraordinary book lifts the lid on the deepest darkest secrets of magic and explores the limits of what can be achieved by the human mind. A must for Derren's legions of fans, it will amaze you, entertain you and expand your mind at the same time...",

            "description": "Whether a marketing campaign or a museum exhibit, a video game or a complex control system, the design we see is the culmination of many concepts and practices brought together from a variety of disciplines. Because no one can be an expert on everything, designers have always had to scramble to find the information and know-how required to make a design work - until now.\u200dUniversal Principles of Design is the first cross-disciplinary reference of design. Richly illustrated and easy to navigate, this book pairs clear explanations of the design concepts featured with visual examples of those concepts applied in practice. From the 80/20 rule to chunking, from baby-face bias to Ockham's razor, and from self-similarity to storytelling, 100 design concepts are defined and illustrated for readers to expand their knowledge.This landmark reference will become the standard for designers, engineers, architects, and students who seek to broaden and improve their design expertise.",

In his deviant pseudo-memoir Happy Endings, Norton delivered his uncensored and controversial brand of humor on everything from his affinity for hookers to his romantic woes. Now, he unflinchingly spews his thoughts on everyone from the bully he despises from high school, to Hillary Clinton and Al Sharpton.Offensive, brutally honest, and most important, sidesplittingly hilarious, I Hate Your Guts features 35 essays showcasing the candid, outrageous brand of dirty comedy that has earned him legions of devoted fans both on the radio and on the road.",

Here Rowell assembled eighty of his finest images, along with the stories behind them\u2014what he was after and how he achieved it.The photographs (and the details of their creation) are arranged in eight exhibits according to visual themes, reflecting Rowell\u2019s fascination with the infinitely varying qualities of light found in mountain landscapes. He explains how film and the human eye see differently, how he selected and composed the content of his work, how he worked with optical phenomena and natural light, and how equipment and adventure interact in the field.The engaging text also recounts Rowell\u2019s development as a photographer, his philosophy and techniques for creating \u201cdynamic landscapes,\u201d and his adventures in remote, dangerous, and beautiful places\u2014from California\u2019s Yosemite Valley to almost-inaccessible peaks in China.",

Hall writes about his lifelong love affair with his ancestral Eagle Pond Farm and the literary life that keeps him going every day: \u00a0\u201cYesterday my first nap was at 9:30 a.m., but when I awoke I wrote again.\u201d",

Is Emily Dickinson \u201cthe female Sade\u201d? Is Donatello\u2019s David a bit of pedophile pornography? What is the secret kinship between Byron and Elvis Presley, between Medusa and Madonna? How do liberals and feminists\u2014as well as conservatives\u2014fatally misread human nature? This audacious and omnivorously learned work of guerrilla scholarship offers nothing less than a unified-field theory of Western culture, high and low, since Egyptians invented beauty\u2014making a persuasive case for all art as a pagan battleground between male and female, form and chaos, civilization and daemonic nature.",

            "description": "The Players: the top poker players on the planet. The Challenger is a wealthy Dallas banker. The Game: the world's most valuable poker stakes... A wealthy Texas man landed onto the lavish Bellagio casino's high-stakes poker room in Las Vegas in 2001. Andy Beal, a self-made billionaire, challenged some of the world's best poker players to heads-up matches in the wealthiest poker game ever played, including Doyle Brunson, Chip Reese, Howard Lederer, and Jennifer Harman.\u00a0Andy and each of his opponents started the thrilling poker tournament with $1 million each, betting $10,000 and $20,000 per round. As the games became more intense in the months ahead, and Andy progressed as a player, he discovered how to push his opponents out of their comfort zones: he raised the stakes to put all they had on the line. There was more than $20 million on the table by the end of the battle of wits. For the first time, a comprehensive, genuine description of the Big Game, which has already attained legendary status in poker lore, is available for the first time. Michael Craig takes you inside the iron-nerved mind and pathological psyche of the professional gambler, putting you rail side to see the heart-pounding action, where you can practically hear the unmistakable sound of clay chips hitting felt. The Professor, the Banker, and the Suicide King is a unique, exciting voyage into the realm of those who live on the razor's edge of fortune\u2014where enormous wealth, or total catastrophe, hinges on the flip of a card\u2014filled with vibrant characters, sensational tales, and riveting human drama.",

            "description": "What elevates 'teaching my mother how to give birth', what gives the poems their disturbing brilliance, is Warsan Shire's ability to give simple, beautiful eloquence to the veiled world where sensuality lives in the dominant narrative of Islam; reclaiming the more nuanced truths of earlier times - as in Tayeb Salih's work - and translating to the realm of lyric the work of the likes of Nawal El Saadawi. As Rumi said, \"Love will find its way through all languages on its own\".In 'teaching my mother how to give birth', Warsan's debut pamphlet, we witness the unearthing of a poet who finds her way through all preconceptions to strike the heart directly. Warsan Shire is a Kenyan-born Somali poet and writer who is based in London. Born in 1988, she is an artist and activist who uses her work to document narratives of journey and trauma. Warsan has read her work internationally, including recent readings in South Africa, Italy and Germany, and her poetry has been translated into Italian, Spanish and Portuguese.",

The Principles of Uncertainty is a collection of Maira Kalman's New York Times articles that offers an enticing invitation to see life through the eyes of a beloved artist. These clever, quirky drawings, ideas, and images - which at first appear random - eventually build an intricately interrelated worldview, an idiosyncratic inner monologue, and are part personal narrative, part documentary, part journey, part chapbook, and all Kalman.",

            "description": "Mae West (1893-1980), an actress, playwright, screenwriter, and famous sex symbol, made a stir on Broadway in 1926 with her play Sex. She was sentenced to ten days in prison after being found guilty of obscenity. She went to prison as a convicted criminal but emerged as a celebrity. Later, in Hollywood, she was the top box-office draw throughout the 1930s, and she helped save Paramount Studios from bankruptcy. Her films included a number of well-known one-liners, many of which she penned herself and have since entered Hollywood legend. Mae's profound desire to see women treated similarly to men, decades before the word \"feminist\" was in the headlines, was hidden under the smart jokes. She saw right through the double standard of the day, which allowed men to do things that would damage women. Her cause was equal rights for women, and she was astute enough to recognise that it was potentially the ultimate battleground.Charlotte Chandler's book She Always Knew How is based on a series of in-depth conversations she did with Mae West only months before her death. Chandler also talked with actors and directors who knew and worked with Mae, as well as her close assistant and the man with whom she spent the last twenty-seven years of her life. Their perspectives provide depth to this intriguing work.",

            "description": "This follow-up to the bestselling Advanced Style features more senior street style and inspiration from all over the globe. In this new edition Ari Seth Cohen shares his work from the past few years including some of the world's best-dressed older gentlemen.Similar in format to the original, with dozens of images from cities all over the world including: Los Angeles, London, Cape Town, Rome, Florence, Tokyo, San Diego, Palm Springs, Melbourne, Sydney, New York, Amsterdam, Edinburgh, Stockholm, and Geneva, the book will also feature 22 short essays (by the subjects of the book) distilling the wisdom and lifestyle secrets of some of Cohen's favorite Advanced Style ladies. Plus an introduction from the always fabulous and witty Simon Doonan makes for a celebration of smashing senior style!\"...I must tell you that I am not really an old lady; just cleverly disguised as one. Art and color keep me young, keep me sane. Working as I do as an untutored 'outsider' artist is my therapy, my medicine, my joy, and my purpose in life.Color surrounds me: I revel in it, splash it everywhere, gulp it with a spoon. I am immersed in art. I make it, collect it, it fills and defines my existence. Childish, shamanistic, wild and anarchic, it is as far outside the box as it is possible to be. Box?? There is no box!Be bold, be adventurous. Do profound things, dazzle yourself and the world. Don't wear beige: it might kill you. Contribute to society, and live large. Life is short, make every moment count. It is never too late to find your passion.\" -- Sue Kreitzman",

            "description": "Painting and Experience in Fifteenth Century Italy An introduction to 15th century Italian painting and the social history behind it, arguing that the two are interlinked and that the conditions of the time helped fashion distinctive elements in the painter's style.Serving as both an introduction to fifteenth-century Italian painting and as a text on how to interpret social history from the style of pictures in a given historical period, this new edition to Baxandall's pre-eminent scholarly volume examines early Renaissance painting, and explains how the style of painting in any society reflects the visual skills and habits that evolve out of daily life. Renaissance painting, for example, mirrors the experience of such activities as preaching, dancing, and gauging barrels. The volume includes discussions of a wide variety of painters, including Filippo Lippi, Fra Angelico, Stefano di Giovanni, Sandro Botticelli, Masaccio, Luca Signorelli, Boccaccio, and countless others. Baxandall also defines and illustrates sixteen concepts used by a contemporary critic of painting, thereby assembling the basic equipment needed to explore fifteenth-century art.",

            "description": "It takes more than just a design school education and a killer portfolio to succeed in a creative career. Burn Your Portfolio teaches the real-world practices, professional do's and don'ts, and unwritten rules of business that most designers, photographers, web designers, copy writers, programmers, and architects only learn after putting in years of experience on the job.Michael Janda, owner of the Utah-based design firm Riser, uses humor to dispense nugget after nugget of hard-won advice collected over the last decade from the personal successes and failures he has faced running his own agency. In this surprisingly funny, but incredibly practical advice guide, Janda's advice on teamwork and collaboration, relationship building, managing clients, bidding work, production processes, and more will resonate with creative professionals of all stripes.",

Whether you\u2019re enraged by Ikea\u2019s Verdanagate, want to know what the Beach Boys have in common with easy Jet or why it\u2019s okay to like Comic Sans, Just My Type will have the answer. Learn why using upper case got a New Zealand health worker sacked. Refer to Prince in the Tafkap years as a Dingbat (that works on many levels). Spot where movies get their time periods wrong and don\u2019t be duped by fake posters on eBay. Simon Garfield meets the people behind the typefaces and along the way learns why some fonts \u2013 like men \u2013 are from Mars and some are from Venus. From type on the high street and album covers, to the print in our homes and offices, Garfield is the font of all types of knowledge.",

            "description": "Mary Oliver was awarded the National Book Award for New and Selected Poems, Volume One. Since its initial appearance it has become one of the best-selling volumes of poetry in the country. This collection features thirty poems published only in this volume as well as selections from the poet's first eight books.Mary Oliver's perceptive, brilliantly crafted poems about the natural landscape and the fundamental questions of life and death have won high praise from critics and readers alike. \"Do you love this world?\" she interrupts a poem about peonies to ask the reader. \"Do you cherish your humble and silky life?\" She makes us see the extraordinary in our everyday lives, how something as common as light can be \"an invitation/to happiness,/and that happiness,/when it's done right,/is a kind of holiness,/palpable and redemptive.\" She illuminates how a near miss with an alligator can be the catalyst for seeing the world \"as if for the second time/the way it really is.\" Oliver's passionate demonstrations of delight are powerful reminders of the bond between every individual, all living things, and the natural world.",

            "description": "From four stunning and accomplished French women--at last--a fresh and spirited take on what it really means to be a Parisienne: how they dress, entertain, have fun and attempt to behave themselves.In short, frisky sections, these Parisian women give you their very original views on style, beauty, culture, attitude and men. The authors--Anne Berest, Audrey Diwan, Caroline de Maigret, and Sophie Mas--unmarried but attached, with children--have been friends for years. Talented bohemian iconoclasts with careers in the worlds of music, film, fashion and publishing, they are untypically frank and outspoken as they debunk the myths about what it means to be a French woman today. Letting you in on their secrets and flaws, they also make fun of their complicated, often contradictory feelings and behavior. They admit to being snobs, a bit self-centered, unpredictable but not unreliable. Bossy and opinionated, they are also tender and romantic.You will be taken on a first date, to a party, to some favorite haunts in Paris, to the countryside, and to one of their dinners at home with recipes even you could do -- but to be out with them is to be in for some mischief and surprises. They will tell you how to be mysterious and sensual, look natural, make your boyfriend jealous, and how they feel about children, weddings and going to the gym. And they will share their address book in Paris for where to go: At the End of the Night, for A Birthday, for a Smart Date, for a A Hangover, for Vintage Finds and much more.\u200dHow to Be Parisian Wherever You Are will make you laugh as you slip into their shoes to become bold and free and tap into your inner cool.",

Resonant with his powerful, perceptive voice, his visceral, hilarious, and transcendent poetry speaks to us as forcefully today as when it was written. Encompassing a wide range of subjects\u2014from love to death and sex to writing\u2014Bukowski\u2019s unvarnished and self-deprecating verse illuminates the deepest and most enduring concerns of the human condition while remaining sharply aware of the day to day.With his acute eye for the ridiculous and the troubled, Bukowski speaks to the deepest longings and strangest predilections of the human experience. Gloomy yet hopeful, this is tough, unrelenting poetry touched by grace.This is Essential Bukowski.",

            "description": "In this collection of satirical pieces and short humorous fiction, Veronica Geng turns up hilarities large and small in government-speak, gender relations, academia, the mass media, love lives, restaurants, airplanes, and baseball fans. \"Often,\" Ian Frazier writes in his introduction, \"her writing was the purest satire, in the sense that its preferred outcome would be for its object to fall down dead.\" Always attuned to the way things sound, Geng was a wicked parodist, a mimic of voices from Henry James to Chandler's private eyes, from LBJ to Pat Robertson. Love Trouble confirms Veronica Geng's place as one of our greatest humorists, who helped to carry the tradition of S.J. Perelman, James Thurber, and Robert Benchley to its illogical conclusion.",

Known as \"microserfs,\" they spend upward of 16 hours a day \"coding\" (writing software) as they eat \"flat\" foods (such as Kraft singles, which can be passed underneath closed doors) and fearfully scan the company email to see what the great Bill might be thinking and whether he is going to \"flame\" one of them. Seizing the chance to be innovators instead of cogs in the Microsoft machine, this intrepid bunch strike out on their own to form a high-tech start-up company named Oop! in Silicon Valley. Living together in a sort of digital flophouse --\"Our House of Wayward Mobility\" -- they desperately try to cultivate well-rounded lives and find love amid the dislocated, subhuman whir and buzz of their computer-driven world.Funny, illuminating and ultimately touching, Microserfs is the story of one generation's very strange and claustrophobic coming of age.",

            "description": "Kenneth Clark's sweeping narrative looks at how Western Europe evolved in the wake of the collapse of the Roman Empire, to produce the ideas, books, buildings, works of art and great individuals that make up our civilisation.The author takes us from Iona in the ninth century to France in the twelfth, from Florence to Urbino, from Germany to Rome, England, Holland and America. Against these historical backgrounds he sketches an extraordinary cast of characters -- the men and women who gave new energy to civilisation and expanded our understanding of the world and of ourselves. He also highlights the works of genius they produced -- in architecture, sculpture and painting, in philosophy, poetry and music, and in science and engineering, from Raphael's School of Athens to the bridges of Brunel.",

This celebration of nearly fifty years of groundbreaking performance art demonstrated once again that Marina Abramovi\u0107 is truly a force of nature.The child of Communist war-hero parents under Tito\u2019s regime in postwar Yugoslavia, she was raised with a relentless work ethic. Even as she was beginning to build an international artistic career, Marina lived at home under her mother\u2019s abusive control, strictly obeying a 10 p.m. curfew. But nothing could quell her insatiable curiosity, her desire to connect with people, or her distinctly Balkan sense of humor\u2014all of which informs her art and her life. The beating heart of Walk Through Walls is an operatic love story\u2014a twelve-year collaboration with fellow performance artist Ulay, much of which was spent penniless in a van traveling across Europe\u2014a relationship that began to unravel and came to a dramatic end atop the Great Wall of China.Marina\u2019s story, by turns moving, epic, and dryly funny, informs an incomparable artistic career that involves pushing her body past the limits of fear, pain, exhaustion, and danger in an uncompromising quest for emotional and spiritual transformation. A remarkable work of performance in its own right, Walk Through Walls is a vivid and powerful rendering of the unparalleled life of an extraordinary artist.",

            "description": "Goethe\u2019s two-part dramatic work, Faust, based on a traditional theme, and finally completed in 1831, is an exploration of that restless intellectual and emotional urge which found its fullest expression in the European Romantic movement, to which Goethe was an early and major contributor. Part I of the work outlines a pact Faust makes with the devil, Mephistopheles, and encompasses the tragedy of Gretchen, whom Faust seduces. Part II, developed over a long period of Goethe\u2019s later life, reflects Goethe\u2019s own transition from a predominantly Romantic to a wider world-view and explores more extensive themes, including the values of the Classical past, as it moves towards the work\u2019s resolution.The protagonist, Faust, is presented in a complex manner, and Goethe\u2019s treatment of the subject matter raises ethical and spiritual issues, many of which are not resolved within the drama itself. Goethe\u2019s stress is on Faust\u2019s striving towards the good, and on the nature of human error, rather than on the traditional Christian view of sin and redemption, and the play\u2019s opening sections and its conclusion can be seen as humanist allegory or metaphor rather than an expression of orthodox religious belief. It is left to the reader to draw their own conclusion about Faust\u2019s everyman character, and the extent to which he earns his ultimate spiritual salvation.The play had an enormous influence on later German thought and literature, and together with his lyric poetry has ensured Goethe\u2019s place among the great European writers.",

            "description": "Learn the basic techniques every successful playwright knows.Among the many \"how-to\" playwriting books that have appeared over the years, there have been few that attempt to analyze the mysteries of play construction. Lajos Egri's classic, The Art of Dramatic Writing, does just that, with instruction that can be applied equally well to a short story, novel, or screenplay.Examining a play from the inside out, Egri starts with the heart of any drama: its characters. All good dramatic writing hinges on people and their relationships, which serve to move the story forward and give it life, as well as an understanding of human motives -- why people act the way that they do. Using examples from everything from William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet to Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House, Egri shows how it is essential for the author to have a basic premise -- a thesis, demonstrated in terms of human behavior -- and to develop the dramatic conflict on the basis of that behavior.Using Egri's ABCs of premise, character, and conflict, The Art of Dramatic Writing is a direct, jargon-free approach to the problem of achieving truth in writing.",

            "description": "The touching, triumphant story of a young black man's journey from violence and despair to one of the world's most elite artistic institutions, as if The Blind Side were set in the world of opera.Ryan Speedo Green had a tough upbringing in southeastern Virginia: his family lived in a trailer park and later a bullet-riddled house across the street from drug dealers. His father was absent; his mother was volatile and abusive.At the age of twelve, Ryan was sent to Virginia's juvenile facility of last resort. He was placed in solitary confinement. He was uncontrollable, uncontainable, with little hope for the future.In 2011, at the age of twenty-four, Ryan won a nationwide competition hosted by New York's Metropolitan Opera, beating out 1,200 other talented singers. Today, he is a rising star performing major roles at the Met and Europe's most prestigious opera houses.SING FOR YOUR LIFE chronicles Ryan's suspenseful, racially charged and artistically intricate journey from solitary confinement to stardom. Daniel Bergner takes readers on Ryan's path toward redemption, introducing us to a cast of memorable characters--including the two teachers from his childhood who redirect his rage into music, and his long-lost father who finally reappears to hear Ryan sing. Bergner illuminates all that it takes--technically, creatively--to find and foster the beauty of the human voice. And Sing for Your Life sheds unique light on the enduring and complex realities of race in America.",

            "description": "The political humorist shares his transformation from dirty hippie to conservative middle-aged grouch: \u201cAn incorrigible comic gift\u201d (The New York Times Book Review). The #1 New York Times\u2013bestselling author of Give War a Chance was at one time a raving pinko, with scars on his formerly bleeding heart to prove it. In Age and Guile: Beat Youth, Innocence, and a Bad Haircut, P. J. O\u2019Rourke chronicles the remarkable trajectory that took him from the lighthearted fun of the revolutionary barricades to the serious business of the nineteenth hole. How did the O\u2019Rourke of 1970, who summarized the world of \u201cgrown-ups\u201d as \u201cmaterialism, sexual hang-ups, the Republican party, uncomfortable clothes, engagement rings, car accidents, Pat Boone, competition, patriotism, cheating, lying, ranch houses, and TV\u201d come to be in favor of all of those things? What caused his metamorphosis from a beatnik-hippie type comfortable sleeping on dirty mattresses in pot-addled communes during his days as a writer for assorted \u201cunderground\u201d papers? Here, O\u2019Rourke shows how his socialist idealism and avant-garde aesthetic tendencies were cured, and how he acquired a healthy and commendable interest in national defense, balanced budgets, Porsches, and Cohiba cigars. From a former editor-in-chief of National Lampoon and frequent NPR guest, this hilarious essay collection shows that there\u2019s hope for all those suffering from acute bohemianism.",

            "description": "The single most critical component in producing a great image is design. One of the most important abilities in photography has always been the ability to see the potential for a powerful image and then organize the visual components into an effective, captivating composition. Digital photography has added a new and interesting dimension to design, first because the fast feedback provided by a digital camera allows for instantaneous evaluation and development, and second because image-editing software allows for changes and enhancements after the shutter has been pressed. This has had a significant impact on how digital photographers capture photographs.The Photographer's Eye is now available in sixteen languages and continues to inspire photographers all around the world. It has sold 100,000 copies in the United States and more than 300,000 copies globally, demonstrating how anybody can learn to perceive and shoot outstanding digital images. The book examines all of the traditional approaches to composition and design, but it also discusses the new digital technique of shooting with the expectation that the image will be edited, manipulated, or montaged later to produce a final image that may differ significantly from the one seen in the viewfinder.",

            "description": "This book offers a novel overview of typeface design, exploring the most beautiful and remarkable examples of font catalogs from the history of publishing, with a special emphasis on the period from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century, when color catalogs were at their height. Taken from a Dutch collection, this exuberant selection traverses the evolution of the printed letter in all its various incarnations via exquisitely designed catalogs displaying not only type specimens in roman, italic, bold, semi-bold, narrow, and broad, but also characters, borders, ornaments, initial letters and decorations as well as often spectacular examples of the use of the letters. The Victorian fonts, sumptuous and sometimes unbelievably outrageous, are accorded a prominent place in this book. In addition to lead letters, examples from lithography and letters by window-dressers, inscription carvers, and calligraphers are also displayed and described.Featuring works by type designers including: William Caslon, Fritz Helmuth Ehmcke, Peter Behrens, Rudolf Koch, Eric Gill, Jan van Krimpen, Paul Renner, Jan Tschichold, A. M. Cassandre, Aldo Novarese, Adrian Frutiger.In order to include a vast amount of material, we have divided this text into two volumes. The first volume displays pre 20th Century type specimens, and the second covers the period from 1900 to the middle of the century. In the first volume, editor Cees de Jong and collector Jan Tholenaar write about single specimens and types; in the second, Alston Purvis outlines the history of types.",

            "description": "Informed by the death of a beloved brother, here are the stories of childhood, its thicket of sex and sorrow and joy, boys and girls growing into men and women, stories of a brother who in his dying could teach how to be most alive. What the Living Do reflects \"a new form of confessional poetry, one shared to some degree by other women poets such as Sharon Olds and Jane Kenyon. Unlike the earlier confessional poetry of Plath, Lowell, Sexton et al., Howe's writing is not so much a moan or a shriek as a song. It is a genuinely feminine form . . . a poetry of intimacy, witness, honesty, and relation\" (Boston Globe).",

He covers a wide range of topics, including what it means to be creative, how to find a mentor and serve as an apprentice, the importance of maintaining a creative network, dealing with critics and the pitfalls of success, and the specific pitfalls of contemporary culture, all in the service of guiding both long-time fans and newcomers unfamiliar with his storey.Questlove talks with the openness and excitement that fans have come to expect, whether addressing his personal life or channeling the lessons he's learned from predecessors like George Clinton, collaborators like D'Angelo, or similar-minded artists like Ava DuVernay, David Byrne, Bj\u00f6rk, and others. Creative Quest is a lot of things, but it's most importantly a thoughtful and wide-ranging discussion on the timeless mystery of creativity.",

He \"received\" a series of poems about which he did not speak for a long time - he considered them sacred, and different from anything else he ever had done and ever would do again. This poet saw the coming darkness of the century, and saw the struggle we would have in our relationship to the divine. The poet was Rainer Maria Rilke, and these love poems to God make up his Book of Hours.",

Indirectly the book illuminates the possibilities contained in such tools and the whole catalog serves an education outside the classroom.

In this, his fourth full-length collection, he revs up both music and experience and writes startling poems of emotional intensity that chronicle the restlessness of desire. Sometimes grim, ever buoyant and hopeful, even in the most sorrowful or macabre situations, the poems of Backwards Days are most particularly about the movement of time, physical movement, and the movement of the heart. Through landscapes both real and of the psyche, they live on the edge of an elusive understanding never quite gotten right.",

            "description": "Alberto Giacometti was born in Switzerland and became a student of the arts early in life. He travelled to Paris in his early twenties and became a painter, sculptor and printmaker. Throughout his life and work he focused on three core themes, standing women, busts and a man in movement. He experimented with surrealism and cubism and kept a riotously colourful list of acquaintances and contemporaries including Picasso and Mir\u00f3.Giacometti was in many ways the perfect subject for a study on the creative process. He was bohemian but still driven. James Lord, an author and his biographer, agreed to sit for a portrait by the artist and this book is the result of his recording of those days. He did not merely experience the day to day activity in the studio or Giacometti's many idiosyncrasies, Lord recorded the artist's emotional state and the tribulations and distractions that occurred over the 18 days of sitting. Lord shows us a man who seems irritable but warm, engaging but absorbed in his work.'Giacometti's Portrait' details Alberto's fixation on his younger brother as a model for his work, his messy surroundings and the cigarette ash dropping to the floor as he became distracted. Creatives of all kinds will appreciate the reliance of Giacometti on the ritual and instinctive in striving to create a meaningful work of art. The two eggs the artist needed to eat, the two glasses of beaujolais and the two cups of coffee that were required are familiar to all of us from the student writing an essay to the artist creating a masterpiece. The earthly fortifications that surround the creation of art which is supposed to transcend them remain fascinating.",

            "description": "Introduction by Jack Kerouac. There is no question that Robert Frank's The Americans is the most famous and influential photography book ever published. It was 1959 when the book first came out: a series of deceptively simple photographs that Frank took on a trip through America in '55 and '56, pictures of normal people, everyday scenes: lunch counters, bus depots, cars, and the stangely familiar faces of people we don't quite know but have seen somewhere. They are pictures that saw the \"American way of life\" as we hadn't yet quite been able to see it ourselves, photographs that condensed the entire life of a nation in classic images that still speak to us today, forty years and several generations later.",

            "description": "The first two volumes chronicling the unique art and design of Roger Dean met with huge critical and popular success. Views (1975) went straight to number one in the Sunday Times bestseller list and went on to sell over a million copies. Magnetic Storm (1984) sold over 650,000 copies. These new editions, reworked to accompany the publication of the third book in the trilogy, Dragon's Dream, showcase the instantly recognizable work of Roger Dean.Views showcases the first seven years of Roger Dean's work after his graduation from the Royal College of Art in 1968. It includes paintings and graphics; branding such as the Yes typography and the first Virgin Records logo; groundbreaking stage sets; and album art including iconic early Yes covers such as the award-winning Tales From Topographic Oceans. The new edition streamlines the original square format and retains the combination of concept sketches and brilliantly displayed finished work. Featuring a new foreword, revised typography, and graphic openers and identifying icons, Views showcases and celebrates the art that defined an era.",

            "description": "\u201cA thorough and sophisticated effort to answer an interesting question: How did an indifferently raised, self-flagellating kid from a just-making-ends-meet, desultorily functioning Long Island family, in Massapequa, turn into Alec Baldwin, gifted actor, familiar public figure, impressively thoughtful person, notorious pugilist? . . . Beautifully written and unexpectedly moving . . . . Baldwin writes with great knowledge about old films, the art of acting, what he has learned from other actors, and about the differences among television, film and theater. . . . He\u2019s a highly literate and fluent writer.\u201d\u2014New York TimesOne of the most accomplished and outspoken actors today chronicles the highs and lows of his life in this beautifully written, candid memoir.Over the past three decades, Alec Baldwin has established himself as one of Hollywood\u2019s most gifted, hilarious, and controversial leading men. From his work in popular movies, including Beetlejuice, Working Girl, Glengarry Glen Ross, The Cooler, and Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Departed to his role as Jack Donaghy on Tina Fey\u2019s irreverent series 30 Rock\u2014for which he won two Emmys, three Golden Globes, and seven Screen Actors Guild Awards\u2014and as Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live, he\u2019s both a household name and a deeply respected actor.In Nevertheless, Baldwin transcends his public persona, making public facets of his life he has long kept private. In this honest, affecting memoir, he introduces us to the Long Island child who felt burdened by his family\u2019s financial strains and his parents\u2019 unhappy marriage; the Washington, DC, college student gearing up for a career in politics; the self-named \"Love Taxi\" who helped friends solve their romantic problems while neglecting his own; the young soap actor learning from giants of the theatre; the addict drawn to drugs and alcohol who struggles with sobriety; the husband and father who acknowledges his failings and battles to overcome them; and the consummate professional for whom the work is everything. Throughout Nevertheless, one constant emerges: the fearlessness that defines and drives Baldwin\u2019s life.Told with his signature candor, astute observational savvy, and devastating wit, Nevertheless reveals an Alec Baldwin we have never fully seen before.",

All the stories of my life were together in that one room and it made me very happy.Who wouldn't want a friend like Graham Norton? A little bit naughty, full of frank advice, bursting with gossip about the world's biggest stars - but most of all with an emphatic love of life and all its joys, big and small.Join him - glass of wine in hand, faithful doggy friend by your side - and delve in as he shares the loves of his life.",

            "description": "Despite its status as one of the oldest and most enduringly popular sports in history, wrestling has been pushed to the background of the current American sports scene. Most people today would have a hard time even considering wrestling (with some of its modern theatrics) in the same terms as track and field or boxing. But until the 1920s, wrestling stood as a legitimate professional sport in this country, and a widely practiced amateur one as well. Its past respectability may not have endured, but the advent of cable television in the 1980s offered the sport a renewed opportunity to play a determining role in American popular culture. This opportunity was not wasted, and wrestlers now assume places in politics and film at the highest levels. Ringside, the first work to fully examine the history of professional wrestling in this country, provides an illuminating and colorful account of all of the various athletes, entertainers, businessmen, and national outlooks that have determined wrestling's erratic route through American history.This chronological work begins with a brief account of wrestling's global history, and then proceeds to investigate the sport's growth as a specifically American institution. Wrestling has continued to survive in the face of technological developments, scandals, public ridicule, and a lack of centralized control, and today this supremely adaptable entertainment form represents, in sum, an international industry capable of attracting enormous television and pay-per-view audiences, along with massive amounts of advertising and merchandizing revenue. Ringside focuses on the business of wrestling as well as on the performers and their in-ring antics, and offers readers a fully nuanced examination of the development of professional wrestling in America.",

            "description": "A painter and architect in his own right, Giorgio Vasari (1511-74) achieved immortality for this book on the lives of his fellow Renaissance artists, first published in Florence in 1550. Although he based his work on a long tradition of biographical writing, Vasari infused these literary portraits with a decidedly modern form of critical judgment. The result is a work that remains to this day the cornerstone of art historical scholarship.Spanning the period from the thirteenth century to Vasari\u2019s own time, the Lives opens a window on the greatest personalities of the period, including Giotto, Brunelleschi, Mantegna, Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Titian. This Modern Library edition, abridged from the original text with notes drawn from earlier commentaries, as well as current research, reminds us why The Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects is indispensable to any student interested in Renaissance art.",

While it's practically required reading in the geek community, xkcd fans are as varied as the comic's subject matter. This book creates laughs from science jokes on one page to relationship humor on another.xkcd: volume 0 is the first book from the immensely popular webcomic with a passionate readership (just Google \"xkcd meetup\").The artist selected personal and fan favorites from his first 600 comics. It was lovingly assembled from high-resolution original scans of the comics (the mouseover text is discreetly included), and features a lot of doodles, notes, and puzzles in the margins.",

            "description": "A bitingly funny grand tour of our culture of excess from an award-winning humorist.Whether David Rakoff's contrasting the elegance of one of the last flights of the supersonic Concorde with the good-times-and-chicken-wings populism of Hooters Air; working as a cabana boy at a South Beach hotel; or traveling to a private island off the coast of Belize to watch a soft-core video shoot where he is provided with his very own personal manservant rarely have greed, vanity, selfishness, and vapidity been so mercilessly skewered. Somewhere along the line, our healthy self-regard has exploded into obliterating narcissism; our manic getting and spending have now become celebrated as moral virtues. Simultaneously a Wildean satire and a plea for a little human decency, Don t Get Too Comfortable shows that far from being bobos in paradise, we are in a special circle of gilded-age hell.",

            "description": "A sparkling collection of Zadie Smith's nonfiction over the past decade.Zadie Smith brings to her essays all of the curiosity, intellectual rigor, and sharp humor that have attracted so many readers to her fiction, and the result is a collection that is nothing short of extraordinary.Split into four sections\u2014\"Reading,\" \"Being,\" \"Seeing,\" and \"Feeling\"\u2014Changing My Mind invites readers to witness the world from Zadie Smith's unique vantage. Smith casts her acute eye over material both personal and cultural, with wonderfully engaging essays-some published here for the first time-on diverse topics including literature, movies, going to the Oscars, British comedy, family, feminism, Obama, Katharine Hepburn, and Anna Magnani.In her investigations Smith also reveals much of herself. Her literary criticism shares the wealth of her experiences as a reader and exposes the tremendous influence diverse writers\u2014E. M. Forster, Zora Neale Hurston, George Eliot, and others\u2014have had on her writing life and her self-understanding. Smith also speaks directly to writers as a craftsman, offering precious practical lessons on process. Here and throughout, readers will learn of the wide-ranging experiences\u2014in novels, travel, philosophy, politics, and beyond\u2014that have nourished Smith's rich life of the mind. Her probing analysis offers tremendous food for thought, encouraging readers to attend to the slippery questions of identity, art, love, and vocation that so often go neglected.\u200dChanging My Mind announces Zadie Smith as one of our most important contemporary essayists, a writer with the rare ability to turn the world on its side with both fact and fiction. Changing My Mind is a gift to readers, writers, and all who want to look at life more expansively.",

            "description": "OTHER COMEDIANS TELL JOKES. PAUL MOONEY TELLS THE TRUTH.For more than forty years\u2014whether writing for Richard Pryor and Saturday Night Live or performing stand-up to sold-out crowds around the country\u2014Paul Mooney has been provocative, incisive . . . and absolutely hilarious. His comedy has always been indisputably real and raw, reflecting race issues in America, and this fascinating, fearless new memoir continues that unapologetically candid tradition.While other stars soared only to crash and burn, Paul Mooney has stayed chiefly behind the scenes, and he\u2019s got a lifetime of stories to show for it. As head writer for The Richard Pryor Show, he helped tear down racial barriers and change the course of comedy. He helped Robin Williams and Sarah Bernhard break into show business. He paved the way for superstars like Eddie Murphy. Few have witnessed as much comedy history as Mooney; even fewer could recount it with such riotous honesty and depth of insight. He reveals the truth about his celebrated partnership with the brilliant, self-destructive Richard Pryor, from their first meeting to the very last joke, and reflects on some of his most notorious moments.Decades ago, Paul Mooney set out not just make audiences laugh but to make them think. Black Is the New White is his blisteringly funny, no-holds-barred memoir of how he continues to succeed wildly at both.",

            "description": "The first major account of the history of reggae, black music journalist Lloyd Bradley describes its origins and development in Jamaica, from ska to rock-steady to dub and then to reggae itself, a local music which conquered the world. There are many extraordinary stories about characters like Prince Buster, King Tubby and Bob Marley. But this is more than a book of music history: it relates the story of reggae to the whole history of Jamaica, from colonial island to troubled independence, and Jamaicans, from Kingston to London.",

And I also believe that their music is as important as the product of any rock group working today.\"\u2014Lester Bangs, Creem (1970)\"[The Stooges'] Fun House is one of the greatest rock & roll records of all time and as great as they were, the Stones never went so deep, the Beatles never sounded so alive, and anyone would have a hard time matching Iggy Pop's ferocity as a vocalist.\"\u2014Scott Seward, The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004)\u200dTOTAL CHAOS is the first book telling Iggy Pop's story of The Stooges from his own words. Grammy winning editor and avid music historian Jeff Gold spent two days at the rock legend's home sharing pictures and memorabilia from his collection. Featuring a trove of unseen photos, TOTAL CHAOS shows and tells, with the help of best-selling author Jon Savage, the story of the Stooges from those tell-all interviews.Iggy Pop is a musician and actor. He was the vocalist for, and is the last remaining original member of the Stooges, a band Rolling Stone lists in their one hundred greatest artists of all time. The Stooges were first active 1967\u20131975, reunited in 2003, and in 2010 were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.",

It is split into four chapters, and each chapter serves a different purpose. Deals with a different pain. Heals a different heartache. 'milk and honey' takes readers through a journey of the most bitter moments in life and finds sweetness in them because there is sweetness everywhere if you are just willing to look.",

            "description": "FOREWORD BY BRENE BROWN and POSTSCRIPT FROM BRAIN PICKINGS CREATOR MARIA POPOVARock star, crowdfunding pioneer, and TED speaker Amanda Palmer knows all about asking. Performing as a living statue in a wedding dress, she wordlessly asked thousands of passersby for their dollars. When she became a singer, songwriter, and musician, she was not afraid to ask her audience to support her as she surfed the crowd (and slept on their couches while touring). And when she left her record label to strike out on her own, she asked her fans to support her in making an album, leading to the world's most successful music Kickstarter.Even while Amanda is both celebrated and attacked for her fearlessness in asking for help, she finds that there are important things she cannot ask for-as a musician, as a friend, and as a wife. She learns that she isn't alone in this, that so many people are afraid to ask for help, and it paralyzes their lives and relationships. In this groundbreaking book, she explores these barriers in her own life and in the lives of those around her, and discovers the emotional, philosophical, and practical aspects of THE ART OF ASKING.Part manifesto, part revelation, this is the story of an artist struggling with the new rules of exchange in the twenty-first century, both on and off the Internet. THE ART OF ASKING will inspire readers to rethink their own ideas about asking, giving, art, and love.",

            "description": "This early autobiography, which takes Dal\u00ed through his late thirties, is as startling and unpredictable as his art. On its first publication, the reviewer of Books observed: \"It is impossible not to admire this painter as writer ... (Dal\u00ed) succeeds in doing exactly what he sets out to do ... communicates the snobbishness, self-adoration, comedy, seriousness, fanaticism, in short the concept of life and the total picture of himself he sets out to portray.\" Superbly illustrated with over eighty photographs of Dal\u00ed and his works, and scores of Dal\u00ed drawings and sketches.",

In Several Short Sentences About Writing, he sets out to help us unlearn that \u201cwisdom\u201d\u2014about genius, about creativity, about writer\u2019s block, topic sentences, and outline\u2014and understand that writing is just as much about thinking, noticing, and learning what it means to be involved in the act of writing. There is no gospel, no orthodoxy, no dogma in this book. Instead it is a gathering of starting points in a journey toward lively, lucid, satisfying self-expression.",

            "description": "Eadweard Muybridge had a significant role in shaping the world as we know it today, which began in California in the late 1800s. This audacious declaration is at the centre of Rebecca Solnit's new book, which combines biography, history, and unique insights into art and technology to create a strikingly innovative portrayal of America on the cusp of modernity. Muybridge's narrative becomes a lens for a bigger storey about the acceleration and industrialization of ordinary life, when he succeeded in photographically recording high-speed motion in 1872.Solnit shows how the peculiar freedoms and opportunities of post\u2013Civil War California led directly to the two industries\u2014Hollywood and Silicon Valley\u2014that have most powerfully defined contemporary society.",

            "description": "What are the secrets of great writers? According to James M. Cain's scathing assessment, \"Working on foreign policy is similar to writing a novel. There are issues that need to be addressed. It isn't all inspiring,\" according to Joan Didion's description of how she writes a book: \"I continuously retype my own lines.\" Every day, I go back to page one and retype what I've already written. It helps me get into a routine \"\u2014Some of the most revelatory and enlightening views from our generation's literary leaders have been produced by The Paris Review. The magazine has interviewed most of America's finest novelists, poets, and playwrights for more than half a century, and the interviews have become classic works of literature, a vital and comprehensive chronicle of the literary life. They've received the prestigious George Polk Award and were a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.Now, the editor of the Paris Review, Philip Gourevitch, presents a brand-new collection of sixteen of the most famous interviews. These interactions, which feature Elizabeth Bishop, Ernest Hemingway, Truman Capote, Rebecca West, and Billy Wilder, are often stunning, always interesting, and contain an enormous range of knowledge, personality, experience, and wit. For all authors and readers, this is a must-have book.",

Its painter hero, the charming and larcenous Gulley Jimson, has an insatiable genius for creation and a no less remarkable appetite for destruction. Is he a great artist? a has-been? or an exhausted, drunken ne'er-do-well? He is without doubt a visionary, and as he criss-crosses London in search of money and inspiration the world as seen though his eyes appears with a newly outrageous and terrible beauty.",

Casual yet insightful, Duchamp reveals himself as a man and an artist whose playful principles toward living freed him to make art that was as unpredictable, complex, and surprising as life itself. Those interviews have never been edited and made public, until now. \"The Afternoon Interviews,\" which includes an introductory interview with Tomkins reflecting on Duchamp as an artist, guide and friend, reintroduces the reader to key ideas of his artistic world and renews Duchamp as a vital model for a new generation of artists.Calvin Tomkins was born in 1925 in Orange, New Jersey. He joined the New Yorker as a staff writer in 1960. His many profiles include John Cage, Robert Rauschenberg, Merce Cunningham, Leo Castelli, Damien Hirst, Richard Serra, Bruce Nauman, Cindy Sherman and Jasper Johns. Tomkins is the author of 12 books, including \"The Bride and the Bachelors\" (1965), \"Living Well Is the Best Revenge\" (1971), \"Lives of the Artists\" (2008) and \"Duchamp: A Biography\" (1996).",

Written by travel expert Herbert Ypma, who has traveled the globe, this book will change the way we envision the perfect vacation.Some 300 photographs capture thirty hidden gems from around the world. Ranging from a dusty working cattle ranch in Arizona to Brazil's best deserted beach to a secluded island paradise off the coast of the French Riviera, these locations offer priceless adventure and beauty--especially because they are relatively inexpensive to visit. Often the best part of the trip is getting there, and Ypma tells engaging stories about how he stumbled upon each place.",

            "description": "A major collection of entirely new poems from the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award-winning author of Time and Materials and The Apple Trees at OlemaA new volume of poetry from Robert Hass is always an event. In Summer Snow, his first collection of poems since 2010, Hass further affirms his position as one of our most highly regarded living poets. Hass\u2019s trademark careful attention to the natural world, his subtle humor, and the delicate but wide-ranging eye he casts on the human experience are fully on display in his masterful collection. Touching on subjects including the poignancy of loss, the serene and resonant beauty of nature, and the mutability of desire, Hass exhibits his virtuosic abilities, expansive intellect, and tremendous readability in one of his most ambitious and formally brilliant collections to date.",

I'm just grateful she has chosen to share her wisdom with the rest of us...\" (Jennifer Weiner, number-one New York Times best-selling author of Best Friends Forever) \"You will love Luvvie Ajayi's I'm Judging You, and you will argue with it, laugh hysterically at it, shout 'AW HELL YES' at it, and carry parts of it in your heart to dissect or inspire... Perfect for starting important and meaty discussions about all of the topics your mama told you never to bring up at polite dinner parties.\" (Jenny Lawson, New York Times best-selling author of Furiously Happy).With over 500,000 readers a month at her enormously popular blog, AwesomelyLuvvie.com, Luvvie Ajayi has become a go-to source for smart takes on pop culture. I'm Judging You is her debut book of humorous essays that dissects our cultural obsessions and calls out bad behavior in our increasingly digital, connected lives\u2014from the importance of the newest Shonda Rhimes television drama to serious discussions of race and media representation to what to do about your fool cousin sharing casket pictures from Grandma's wake on Facebook. With a lighthearted, razor-sharp wit and a unique perspective, I'm Judging You is the audiobook the world needs, doling out the hard truths and a road map for bringing some \"act right\" into our lives, social media, and popular culture.",

            "description": "A retrospective of Linda McCartney's life and photography.In 1966, during a brief stint as a receptionist for Town and Country magazine, Linda Eastman snagged a press pass to a very exclusive promotional event for the Rolling Stones aboard a yacht on the Hudson River; her fresh, candid photographs of the band were far superior to the formal shots made by the band\u2019s official photographer, and she was instantly on the way to making a name for herself as a top rock \u2019n\u2019 roll photographer. On May 11, 1968, when her portrait of Eric Clapton was featured on the cover of Rolling Stone, she entered the record books as the first woman to have that honor. During her tenure as the leading photographer of the late 1960s\u2019 musical scene, she captured many of rock\u2019s most important musicians on film, including Aretha Franklin, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin, Simon & Garfunkel, The Who, The Doors, and the Grateful Dead. In 1967, Linda went to London to document the \"Swinging Sixties,\" where she met Paul McCartney at the Bag \u2019o Nails club and subsequently photographed the Beatles during a launch event for the Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band album. Paul and Linda fell in love, and were married on March 12, 1969. For the next three decades, until her untimely death, she devoted herself to her family, vegetarianism, animal rights, and photography.From her early rock \u2019n\u2019 roll portraits, through the final years of the Beatles, via touring with Wings to raising four children with Paul, Linda captured her whole world on film. Her shots range from spontaneous family pictures to studio sessions with Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson, as well as artists Willem de Kooning and Gilbert and George. Always unassuming and fresh, her work displays a warmth and feeling for the precise moment that captures the essence of any subject. Whether photographing her children, celebrities, animals, or a fleeting moment of everyday life, she did so without pretension or artifice.This retrospective volume\u2014selected from her archive of over 200,000 images\u2014is produced in close collaboration with Paul McCartney and their children. As such, it is a moving personal journal and a lasting testament to Linda\u2019s talent.Additional to our limited and art editions, this book is also available as unlimited trade edition.",

            "description": "The Past From Above features aerial photographs of 250 of the world's most notable archaeological sites. The photographer, Georg Gerster, has been documenting historic sites from the air for more than fifty years. In this collection, he covers a wide range of subjects, including the Karnak temple complex in Egypt, the Great Wall of China, the Acropolis in Athens, and Aztec palaces in Mexico. Gerster's photographs are technological wonders in and of themselves, often shot in difficult settings, but they also serve as a visual history of humanity stretching back to the dawn of civilization. Charlotte Trumpler introduces the photographs with an introduction of the relevance of aerial photography in archaeological research.\u200d",

            "description": "John Milton's Paradise Lost is one of the greatest epic poems in the English language. It tells the story of the Fall of Man, a tale of immense drama and excitement, of rebellion and treachery, of innocence pitted against corruption, in which God and Satan fight a bitter battle for control of mankind's destiny. The struggle rages across three worlds - heaven, hell, and earth - as Satan and his band of rebel angels plot their revenge against God. At the center of the conflict are Adam and Eve, who are motivated by all too human temptations but whose ultimate downfall is unyielding love.Marked by Milton's characteristic erudition, Paradise Lost is a work epic both in scale and, notoriously, in ambition. For nearly 350 years, it has held generation upon generation of audiences in rapt attention, and its profound influence can be seen in almost every corner of Western culture.",

Oceanic is both a title and an ethos of radical inclusion, inviting in the grief of an elephant, the icy eyes of a scallop, \u201cthe ribs / of a silver silo,\u201d and the bright flash of painted fingernails. With unmatched sincerity, Oceanic speaks to each reader as a cooperative part of the natural world\u2014the extraordinary neighborhood to which we all belong. This is a poet ecstatically, emphatically, naming what it means to love a world in peril.",

            "description": "\"The most acute rendering of an era\u2019s sensibility is its poetry,\" wrote the editors in their preface to the first edition.Thirty years later, this innovative, cover-to-cover revision renders with fresh eyes and meticulous care the remarkable range of styles, subjects, and voices in English-language poetry. The newly titled Norton Anthology of Modern and Contemporary Poetry\u2015now available in two paperback volumes\u2015includes 1,596 poems by 195 poets (half of the poems are new), from Walt Whitman and Thomas Hardy in the late nineteenth century to Anne Carson and Sherman Alexie in the twenty-first. The Norton Anthology of Modern and Contemporary Poetry continues to be the most comprehensive collection of twentieth-century poetry in English. It richly represents the major figures, while also giving full voice to ethnic American poetries, experimental traditions, postcolonial poetry, and the long poem, eclipsing all other anthologies in scope, clarity, and balance.",

            "description": "W. Somerset Maugham had a variety of lives, including that of a slum doctor, a prominent playwright and author, a British Intelligence operative during Global War I, and a world wanderer. In 1917, he embarked on the first of several trips to the Pacific Islands and the Far East, where he found inspiration for some of his best work.One of Maugham's most renowned stories, about a missionary and a prostitute, is included in Rain and Other South Sea Stories. \"Rain\" was adapted for the stage and filmed three times, with Gloria Swanson, Joan Crawford, and Rita Hayworth playing the starring roles. \"Macintosh,\" a psychological study of two officials' competition; \"The Fall of Edward Barnard,\" a story of social rebellion that foreshadows The Razor's Edge; \"The Pool,\" a portrait of a marriage between people from different cultures; and other compelling stories of life in the tropics are also included in this collection.",

            "description": "Harley Flanagan provides a fascinating memoir: a child prodigy and family friend of Andy Warhol and Allen Ginsberg, at a young age he became close to many stars of the early punk rock scene like Joe Strummer of The Clash and was taught to play bass by members of the famed black punk band Bad Brains. He started playing drums for the New York punk band the Stimulators when he was 11 years old; playing at places like Max's Kansas City with some of the most notable names of the punk scene. He then went on to start the notorious hardcore band Cro-Mags.From the memoir's introduction by American Hardcore's Steven Blush: \"Harley Flanagan is not like you or me. Most of us grew up in relative safety and security. Harley came up like a feral animal, fending for himself in the '70s Lower East Side jungle of crime, drugs, abuse and poverty. By age 10 he was a downtown star at Max's Kansas City and CBGB, drumming in his aunt's punk band The Stimulators, and socializing with Blondie's Debbie Harry and Cleveland's Dead Boys. Everyone thought it was so cute, but it wasn't.\"Currently a black belt and an instructor for the famed Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Academy in New York, Harley was never shy: making friends with important figures like Lemmy Kilmister of Mot\u00f6rhead, defending himself in street battles, and finding media play and court battles after former band members betrayed their one-time friend and bandmate.Of his much anticipated memoir, famed author and celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain explains: \"Don't even pretend to talk about New York... if you don't read this.\" \"This book is the punch in the face you want and need.\"",

Packed with utopian plans, clever insights and light-hearted musings, all aimed at reminding us that we are verbs, not nouns, and that we are never, ever, stuck with life as it is as we can create things. Fuller was awarded 25 patents, invented the geodesic dome and the dymaxion car and was expelled from Harvard twice.",

            "description": "A gorgeously unique, fully illustrated exploration into the phenomenology of reading-how we visualize images from reading works of literature, from one of our very best book jacket designers, himself a passionate reader. A VINTAGE ORIGINAL.What do we see when we read? Did Tolstoy really describe Anna Karenina? Did Melville ever really tell us what, exactly, Ishmael looked like?The collection of fragmented images on a page - a graceful ear there, a stray curl, a hat positioned just so - and other clues and signifiers helps us to create an image of a character. But in fact our sense that we know a character intimately has little to do with our ability to concretely picture our beloved - or reviled - literary figures.In this remarkable work of nonfiction, Knopf's Associate Art Director Peter Mendelsund combines his profession, as an award-winning designer; his first career, as a classically trained pianist; and his first love, literature - he thinks of himself first, and foremost, as a reader - into what is sure to be one of the most provocative and unusual investigations into how we understand the act of reading.",

            "description": "The proximity of the East L.A. barrio to Hollywood is as close as a short drive on the 101 freeway, but the cultural divide is enormous. Born to Mexican-born and American-naturalized parents, Alicia Armendariz migrated a few miles west to participate in the free-range birth of the 1970s punk movement. Alicia adopted the punk name Alice Bag, and became lead singer for The Bags, early punk visionaries who starred in Penelope Spheeris' documentary The Decline of Western Civilization.Here is a life of many crossed boundaries, from East L.A.'s musica ranchera to Hollywood's punk rock; from a violent male-dominated family to female-dominated transgressive rock bands. Alice's feminist sympathies can be understood by the name of her satiric all-girl early Goth band Castration Squad.\u200dViolence Girl takes us from a violent upbringing to an aggressive punk sensibility; this time a difficult coming-of-age memoir culminates with a satisfying conclusion, complete with a happy marriage and children. Nearly a hundred excellent photographs energize the text in remarkable ways.Alice Bag's work and influence can be seen this year in the traveling Smithsonian exhibition \"American Sabor: Latinos in U.S. Popular Music.\"",

His imaginative thesis, that \"the two masks the theater shows us are in actuality the same face, worn by the same man, reporting the same event,\" is here worked out with typical seriousness and style. His conclusions point toward a reevaluation of both the theater of the past and the present-day stage. He is one of the few critics able to instruct and entertain, without pedantry or playing to the balcony. He has never been in better form than in this book, which will benefit working dramatists, literary theorists, or the most casual theater-goer.",

Sarris's The American Cinema, the bible of auteur studies, is a history of American film in the form of a lively guide to the work of two hundred film directors, from Griffith, Chaplin, and von Sternberg to Mike Nichols, Stanley Kubrick, and Jerry Lewis. In addition, the book includes a chronology of the most important American films, an alphabetical list of over 6000 films with their directors and years of release, and the seminal essays \"Toward a Theory of Film History\" and \"The Auteur Theory Revisited.\" Over twenty-five years after its initial publication, The American Cinema remains perhaps the most influential book ever written on the subject.",

YOU'LL GROW OUT OF IT hilariously, and candidly, explores the journey of the twenty-first century woman.As both a tomboy and a late bloomer, comedian Jessi Klein grew up feeling more like an outsider than a participant in the rites of modern femininity.In YOU'LL GROW OUT OF IT, Klein offers - through an incisive collection of real-life stories - a relentlessly funny yet poignant take on a variety of topics she has experienced along her strange journey to womanhood and beyond. These include her \"transformation from Pippi Longstocking-esque tomboy to are-you-a-lesbian-or-what tom man,\" attempting to find watchable porn, and identifying the difference between being called \"ma'am\" and \"miss\" (\"Miss\" sounds like you weigh ninety-nine pounds).Raw, relatable, and consistently hilarious, YOU'LL GROW OUT OF IT is a one-of-a-kind book by a singular and irresistible comic voice.",

Now, it's your turn. Jump!\"Zest. Gusto. Curiosity. These are the qualities every writer must have, as well as a spirit of adventure. In this exuberant book, the incomparable Ray Bradbury shares the wisdom, experience, and excitement of a lifetime of writing. Here are practical tips on the art of writing from a master of the craft\u2014everything from finding original ideas to developing your own voice and style\u2014as well as the inside story of Bradbury's own remarkable career as a prolific author of novels, stories, poems, films, and plays.\u200dZen in the Art of Writing is more than just a how-to manual for the would-be writer: it is a celebration of the act of writing itself that will delight, impassion, and inspire the writer in you. Bradbury encourages us to follow the unique path of our instincts and enthusiasms to the place where our inner genius dwells, and he shows that success as a writer depends on how well you know one subject: your own life.",

            "description": "An intimate and poignant graphic novel portraying one family\u2019s journey from war-torn Vietnam, from debut author Thi Bui. This beautifully illustrated and emotional story is an evocative memoir about the search for a better future and a longing for the past. Exploring the anguish of immigration and the lasting effects that displacement has on a child and her family, Bui documents the story of her family\u2019s daring escape after the fall of South Vietnam in the 1970s, and the difficulties they faced building new lives for themselves.At the heart of Bui\u2019s story is a universal struggle: While adjusting to life as a first-time mother, she ultimately discovers what it means to be a parent\u2014the endless sacrifices, the unnoticed gestures, and the depths of unspoken love. Despite how impossible it seems to take on the simultaneous roles of both parent and child, Bui pushes through. With haunting, poetic writing and breathtaking art, she examines the strength of family, the importance of identity, and the meaning of home.In what Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen calls \u201ca book to break your heart and heal it,\u201d The Best We Could Do brings to life Thi Bui\u2019s journey of understanding, and provides inspiration to all of those who search for a better future while longing for a simpler past.",

            "description": "From the guitarist of the pioneering band Sleater-Kinney, the book Kim Gordon says \"everyone has been waiting for\" and a New York Times Notable Book of 2015-- a candid, funny, and deeply personal look at making a life--and finding yourself--in music.Before Carrie Brownstein became a music icon, she was a young girl growing up in the Pacific Northwest just as it was becoming the setting for one the most important movements in rock history. Seeking a sense of home and identity, she would discover both while moving from spectator to creator in experiencing the power and mystery of a live performance. With Sleater-Kinney, Brownstein and her bandmates rose to prominence in the burgeoning underground feminist punk-rock movement that would define music and pop culture in the 1990s. They would be cited as \u201cAmerica\u2019s best rock band\u201d by legendary music critic Greil Marcus for their defiant, exuberant brand of punk that resisted labels and limitations, and redefined notions of gender in rock. HUNGER MAKES ME A MODERN GIRL is an intimate and revealing narrative of her escape from a turbulent family life into a world where music was the means toward self-invention, community, and rescue. Along the way, Brownstein chronicles the excitement and contradictions within the era\u2019s flourishing and fiercely independent music subculture, including experiences that sowed the seeds for the observational satire of the popular television series Portlandia years later.With deft, lucid prose Brownstein proves herself as formidable on the page as on the stage. Accessibly raw, honest and heartfelt, this book captures the experience of being a young woman, a born performer and an outsider, and ultimately finding one\u2019s true calling through hard work, courage and the intoxicating power of rock and roll.",

Writing at the height of his career, Rand articulated in his slender volume the pioneering vision that all design should seamlessly integrate form and function. This facsimile edition preserves Rand's original 1947 essay with the adjustments he made to its text and imagery for a revised printing in 1970, and adds only an informative and inspiring new foreword by design luminary Michael Bierut. As relevant today as it was when first published, this classic treatise is an indispensable addition to the library of every designer.",

            "description": "The Collected Poems of W. B. Yeats includes all of the poems authorized by Yeats for inclusion in his standard canon. Breathtaking in range, it encompasses the entire arc of his career, from luminous reworking of ancient Irish myths and legends, to passionate meditations on the demands and rewards of youth and old age, from exquisite, occasionally whimsical songs of love, nature, and art to somber and angry poems of life in a nation torn by war and uprising. In observing the development of rich and recurring images and themes over the course of his body of work, we can trace the quest of this century's greatest poet to unite intellect and artistry in a single magnificent vision.Revised and corrected, this edition includes Yeat's own notes on his poetry, complemented by explanatory notes from esteemed Yeats scholar Richard J. Finneran. The Collected Poems of W. B. Yeats is the most comprehensive edition of one of the world's most beloved poets available in paperback.",

            "description": "Roz Chast's debut book tackles the problem of ageing parents with her trademark humor. Chast's book provides both comfort and comedic relief for anybody dealing with the life-altering death of elderly parents. It spans several years of their lives and is conveyed through four-color cartoons, family pictures, and documents, as well as a narrative as replete with chuckles as it is with tears.Roz used denial, evasion, and diversion when it came to her ageing mother and father. The tools that had served Roz well through her parents' seventies, eighties, and early nineties could no longer be used when Elizabeth Chast scaled a ladder to seek an old relic from the \"crazy closet\"\u2014with predictable results.While the specifics are Chast-ian in their eccentricities\u2014an anxious father who had relied heavily on his wife for stability as he slipped into dementia and a former assistant principal mother whose overbearing personality had kept Roz out of the classroom for decades\u2014the themes are universal: adult children accepting parental roles; ageing and unstable parents leaving a family home for an institution; dealing with uncomfortable physical intimacies; managing logistics; and hiring stray children.Can't We Talk About Something More Pleasant is a stunning depiction of two lives at their end and an only kid coping as best she can. It will demonstrate the full breadth of Roz Chast's talent as a cartoonist and storyteller.",

            "description": "The debut collection of a poet whose savage, hilarious work has already received extraordinary notice.Since his poems first began to appear in the pages of The New Yorker and Poetry, there has been a lot of excited talk about the fresh and inventive work of Michael Robbins. Equal parts hip- hop, John Berryman, and capitalism seeking death and not finding it, Robbins's poems are strange, wonderful, wild, and completely unlike anything else being written today. As allusive as the Cantos, as aggressive as a circular saw, this debut collection will offend none but the virtuous.\"Every once in a while, a book appears as if out of nowhere, uncanny in its authority, combining the shock of the new with the shock of recognition. Michael Robbins's Alien vs. Predator has given me a sense of what early readers of The Waste Land must have felt in 1922, what it must have been like to pick up a copy of Wise Blood at the bookstore in 1952.\"--John Wilson, Commonweal\"You don't get the instant satisfaction you might expect from a poet hungrily stalking the moment; Robbins's poems have their own distinctly contemporary appeal: They slowly develop into embarrassing pictures of ourselves. They aren't just shiny and fun, they're also sharp -- which makes them quite dangerous.\"--The Boston Globe\"The first important poet whose work can be appreciated only with an Internet connection, Robbins is a lot more than the first 'Google poet.' He is also a significant new poetic voice and, quite possibly, a living poet with a chance of developing a genuine popular following.\"--The Weekly Standard\"If later John Ashbery and David McGimpsey have proven that capitalist popular culture is a suitable subject for poetry, Robbins goes a step further and attempts its formal mimesis. And he does it really goddamn well.\"--The National Post",

            "description": "Interior design guru Axel Vervoordt shares his latest inspirations for the home. Axel Vervoordt\u2019s intense curiosity has fueled his work as an interior designer, spurring him to explore and draw inspiration from cultures around the globe. He was first exposed to Eastern art and philosophy years ago, but today it has become the guiding principle in his work, particularly the concept of Wabi. Developed in the twelfth century, Wabi advocates simplicity and humility, the rejection of all that is superfluous or artificial. Through extraordinary photographs from Japan and Korea to Belgium and Switzerland, Vervoordt invites us to explore the elements that inspire him: natural materials and time-worn objects that evoke the essence of Wabi. Today, together with the Japanese architect Tatsuro Miki, Vervoordt carries the principles of Wabi into his remarkable interiors. As Vervoordt reveals how he infuses his current creations with a fundamentally oriental approach, interiors devotees will gain new insight from this tribute to the designer\u2019s latest sources of inspiration for the home.",

            "description": "Before our history began, another now forgotten civilization thrived. The people who roamed Early Earth were much like us: curious, emotional, funny, ambitious, and vulnerable. In this series of illustrated and linked tales, Isabel Greenberg chronicles the explorations of a young man as he paddles from his home in the North Pole to the South Pole. There, he meets his true love, but their romance is ill-fated. Early Earth's unusual and finicky polarity means the lovers can never touch.As intricate and richly imagined as the work of Chris Ware, and leavened with a dry wit that rivals Kate Beaton's in Hark! A Vagrant, Isabel Greenberg's debut will be a welcome addition to the thriving graphic novel genre.",

            "description": "For the first time ever, the controversial and polarizing bad boy of R&B tells the raw and unvarnished story of his life from New Edition to Whitney and beyond. In MY PREROGATIVE, Brown will for the first time tell the full story of his life and set the record straight, particularly about his relationship with Whitney Houston.Bobby Brown has been one of the most compelling American artists of the past 30 years, a magnetic and talented figure who successfully crossed over many musical genres, including R&B and hip hop, as well as the mainstream. In the late 1980s, the former front man of New Edition had a wildly successful solo career-especially with the launch of DON'T BE CRUEL-garnering multiple hits on the Billboard top ten list, as well as several Grammy, American Music, and Soul Train awards. But Brown put his career on hold to be with the woman he loved-American music royalty Whitney Houston. The marriage between Brown and Houston was perhaps the most closely watched and talked about marriage of the 1990's-a pairing that obsessed the public and the gossip industry. Now, for the first time, the world will be able to hear the truth from the mouth of America's \"bad boy\" himself. Raw and powerful, MY PREROGATIVE is the story of a man who has been on the top of the mountain and in the depths of the valley and who is now finally ready to talk about his career and family life, from the passion and the excess to his creative inspirations and massive musical success.On the process of writing this book, Bobby says, \"Right after I signed on to write my story, I went through one of the most agonizing traumas I had ever experienced with the death of my daughter. But I was surprised by how therapeutic it was to work on this project, to look at the entire arc of my life and to realize that although there has been considerable pain, I have also been incredibly blessed. I hope my fans and other readers of this book will be entertained by this trip into the crazy, exciting, fascinating world of Bobby Brown. And I hope they will feel that I have been as honest and open with them in these pages as I have tried to be my entire life.\"",

            "description": "Through twenty-six innovative maps and insightful articles, Nonstop Metropolis, the last edition in a trilogy of atlases, communicates many unconstrained experiences of New York City. It examines the five boroughs of New York City and parts of surrounding New Jersey, drawing on the expertise of dozens of specialists ranging from linguists to music historians, ethnographers, urbanists, and environmental journalists, as well as cartographers, painters, and photographers. We're welcomed on a journey across Manhattan's playgrounds, from multilingual Queens to multifaceted Brooklyn, and from the tenacious Bronx to Staten Island's mythical kung fu hip-hop center.The writers to this beautifully designed and beautifully drawn book laud New York City's distinctive energy, avant-garde incubation, and literary legacy, but they also criticize the city's racial and economic inequalities, environmental effect, and erasing of its past. Nonstop Metropolis allows us to delve into New York's hidden layers, examine its political clout, and uncover the unexpected in one of the world's most recognizable cities. It's both a challenge and a tribute to how New Yorkers perceive their city, as well as how the rest of the world sees this metropolis of commerce, culture, immigration, and more.",

She said she had two rules she followed absolutely: to tell the truth, and not to do anything she didn't want to do. Her integrity shines throughout If You Want to Write, her best-selling classic on the process of writing that has already inspired thousands to find their own creative center. Carl Sandburg called this book \"The best book ever written about how to write.\" Yet Ueland reminds us that \"Whenever I say 'writing' in this book, I also mean anything that you love and want to do or to make.\" Ueland's writing and her teaching are made compelling by her feisty spirit of independence and joy.",

            "description": "For designers working in every medium, layout is arguably the most basic, and most important, element. Effective layout is essential to communication and enables the end user not only to be drawn in with an innovative design but to digest information easily. Making and Breaking the Grid is a comprehensive layout design workshop that assumes that in order to effectively break the rules of grid-based design, one must first understand those rules and see them applied in real-world projects.Text reveals top designers' work in process and rationale. Projects with similar characteristics are linked through a simple notational system that encourages exploration and comparison of structure ideas. Also included are historical overviews that summarize the development of layout concepts, both grid-based and non-grid based, in modern design practice.",

            "description": "Henry V is Shakespeare\u2019s most famous \u201cwar play\u201d; it includes the storied English victory over the French at Agincourt. Some of it glorifies war, especially the choruses and Henry\u2019s speeches urging his troops into battle. But we also hear bishops conniving for war to postpone a bill that would tax the church, and soldiers expecting to reap profits from the conflict. Even in the speeches of Henry and his nobles, there are many chilling references to the human cost of war.",

            "description": "Karl Lagerfeld once said that if you close your eyes and imagine the ideal French woman, it would be Carine Roitfeld. She is a fashion visionary and a muse. Since the start of her career in the early 1990s, through her collaborations with the legendary photographer Mario Testino, Roitfeld has been credited with launching Tom Ford's career at Gucci, as well as turning French Vogue into one of the industry's most worshipped magazines.This elegant volume is a visual history of Roitfeld's fearless career. A daring instigator, she is known for pushing the limits with her subversive styling ideas. Featuring a selection of 250 magazine tear sheets and covers from pivotal editorial shoots and advertising campaigns, as well as intimate visual ephemera, this book gives an inside view into Roitfeld's creative thought process and sensibility. A must-have for those interested in cutting-edge fashion and femininity, this book will empower women to follow Roitfeld's lead and take risks with their personal style.",

            "description": "The authoritative oral history of the legendary and popular television show The Wire, as told by the performers, writers, directors, and others involved in its development.HBO's critically acclaimed criminal drama The Wire has only grown in popularity and influence since its final episode aired in 2008. The issues it addressed have become increasingly important and fundamental to the national discussion, ranging from the failings of the drug war and criminal justice system to systematic prejudice in law enforcement and other social institutions. Idris Elba, Dominic West, and Michael B. Jordan, among others, have gone on to become significant stars as a result of their roles in the show. David Simon and Richard Price, among the show's founders and writers, have established cult followings of their own. The show is used at universities to teach a variety of subjects, including cinema theory, criminal justice, and sociology. When politicians and activists talk about policy, they bring it up. The Wire has consistently ranked first on reviewers' rankings of the Greatest TV Shows of All Time. It is perhaps one of America's greatest works of art from the twentieth century.\u00a0But, while the program and its ideas have gotten a lot of critical attention, there has never been a comprehensive behind-the-scenes look at how it was created. Jonathan Abrams chronicles the fascinating, riveting, and full story of The Wire, from its origin and development to its death and tremendous legacy, with unprecedented access to all of the main performers and writers involved in its production.",

Calls came in from people around the country eager to tell Linda how her words had touched their hearts. That was the beginning of an enduring phenomenon. \"Live Your Dash\" captures and expands upon the theme of the original poem: It's not your birth or death that matters most, but how you spend each passing year. Linda shares her message of joy, hope, and positive energy through uplifting stories, essays, and poetry, along with tales of people who have been \"touched by the dash,\" including Bob Dole, legendary football coach Lou Holtz, and \"American Idol\" winner David Cook. An inspiring look at life based on the fantastically successful poem.",

The thoroughly revised edition of the 1965 design ma-nual classic is still setting standards. Especially in times of the re-turn to clear and minimalistic geomet-ric forms and patterns, his rich body of work serves as a perfect starting point for contemporary design practices. Elements of image and form are ana-lyzed and examined with regard to their inherent laws. To correspond to the contemporary design techniques, this new edition is divided into computer-system-friendly sections. Thus adapting Hofmann\u2019s methods to the requirement of modern design practices and serv-ing as a valuable handbook for a new generation of designers.",

            "description": "After his acclaimed and best-selling Finishing the Hat (named one of the New York Times 10 Best Books of 2010), Stephen Sondheim returns with the second volume of his collected lyrics, Look, I Made a Hat, giving us another remarkable glimpse into the brilliant mind of this living legend, and his life\u2019s work.Picking up where he left off in Finishing the Hat, Sondheim gives us all the lyrics, along with excluded songs and early drafts, of the Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning Sunday in the Park with George, Into the Woods, Assassins and Passion. Here, too, is an in-depth look at the evolution of Wise Guys, which subsequently was transformed into Bounce and eventually became Road Show. Sondheim takes us through his contributions to both television and film, some of which may surprise you, and covers plenty of never-before-seen material from unproduced projects as well. There are abundant anecdotes about his many collaborations, and readers are treated to rare personal material in this volume, as Sondheim includes songs culled from commissions, parodies and personal special occasions over the years\u2014such as a hilarious song for Leonard Bernstein\u2019s seventieth birthday. As he did in the previous volume, Sondheim richly annotates his lyrics with invaluable advice on songwriting, discussions of theater history and the state of the industry today, and exacting dissections of his work, both the successes and the failures.Filled with even more behind-the-scenes photographs and illustrations from Sondheim\u2019s original manuscripts, Look, I Made a Hat is fascinating, devourable and essential reading for any fan of the theater or this great man\u2019s work.",

            "description": "A number one bestseller in Britain, Stephen Fry's astonishingly frank, funny, wise memoir is the book that his fans everywhere have been waiting for. Since his PBS television debut in the Blackadder series, the American profile of this multi-talented writer, actor and comedian has grown steadily, especially in the wake of his title role in the film Wilde, which earned him a Golden Globe nomination, and his supporting role in A Civil Action. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fry has already given readers a taste of his tumultuous adolescence in his autobiographical first novel, The Liar, and now he reveals the equally tumultuous life that inspired it. Sent to boarding school at the age of seven, he survived beatings, misery, love affairs, carnal violation, expulsion, attempted suicide, criminal conviction and imprisonment to emerge, at the age of eighteen, ready to start over in a world in which he had always felt a stranger. One of very few Cambridge University graduates to have been imprisoned prior to his freshman year, Fry is a brilliantly idiosyncratic character who continues to attract controversy, empathy and real devotion.",

As the successor to Emil Ruder at the world-famous Schule fur Gestultung in Basel, he enhanced the rigor of Swiss Typography with experimental verve and creativity; he also put his innovative ideas to work for Typografische Monatsblutter. Countless designers in North America and Europe have been inspired by his teachings and lectures. In Typography, Weingart sums up an impressive lifework in 500 pages that describe his own development and the foundations of his teachings. This is a long-awaited book of epochal significance.",

Ruth Gendler's evocative book has as its cast of familiar characters our own emotions, brought to life with a poet's wisdom and an artist's perceptive eye. In The Book of Qualities' magical community, Excitement wears orange socks, Faith lives in the same apartment building as Doubt, and Worry makes lists of everything that could go wrong while she is waiting for the train. In portraying the complexities of the psyche, Gendler uses the Qualities to bridge the distinctions between literature and psychology, and has created an original work that challenges us to look at our emotions in new and inspiring ways.",

With How to Write an Autobiographical Novel, his first collection of nonfiction, he\u2019s sure to secure his place as one of the finest essayists of his generation as well.\u200dHow to Write an Autobiographical Novel is the author\u2019s manifesto on the entangling of life, literature, and politics, and how the lessons learned from a life spent reading and writing fiction have changed him. In these essays, he grows from student to teacher, reader to writer, and reckons with his identities as a son, a gay man, a Korean American, an artist, an activist, a lover, and a friend. He examines some of the most formative experiences of his life and the nation\u2019s history, including his father\u2019s death, the AIDS crisis, 9/11, the jobs that supported his writing\u2014Tarot-reading, bookselling, cater-waiting for William F. Buckley\u2014the writing of his first novel, Edinburgh, and the election of Donald Trump.By turns commanding, heartbreaking, and wry, How to Write an Autobiographical Novel asks questions about how we create ourselves in life and in art, and how to fight when our dearest truths are under attack.",

A year before its publication Thomas died from swelling of the brain triggered by excessive drinking. (A piece of New Directions history: it was our founder James Laughlin who identified Thomas\u2019 body at the morgue of St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital.)Since its initial publication in 1953, this book has become the definitive edition of the poet\u2019s work. Thomas wrote \u201cPrologue\u201d addressed to \u201cmy readers, the strangers\u201d \u2015 an introduction in verse that was the last poem he would ever write. Also included are classics such as \u201cAnd Death Shall Have No Dominion,\u201d \u201cDo Not Go Gentle into that Good Night,\u201d and \u201cFern Hill\u201d that have influenced generations of artists from Bob Dylan (who changed his last name from Zimmerman in honor of the poet), to John Lennon (The Beatles included Thomas\u2019 portrait on the cover of Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band); this collection even appears in the film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy\u2019s The Road when it is retrieved from the rubble of a bookshelf.",

            "description": "From the renowned comedian, creator and star of Comedy Central's Important Things with Demetri Martin comes the paperback debut of his bold, original, New York Times best-selling humor book.THIS IS A BOOK was an instant and long-lasting New York Times best seller, and is the renowned comedian's hilarious foray into prose comedy. In these pages, Martin expands on the sensibility he's developed on stage as an award-winning stand-up comedian and on television as a writer-performer on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, and his own Comedy Central series, Important Things with Demetri Martin.Featuring narrative essays, short stories, and conceptual pieces (such as \"Protagonists' Hospital,\" where doctors treat only the shoulder wounds of Hollywood action heroes) as well as Martin's signature drawings, absurdities, and one-liners, THIS IS A BOOK delivers sharp jokes, colorful characters, and interesting surprises.Martin takes readers to places as far-off as Ancient Greece (\"Socrates's Publicist\") and the distant future (\"Robot Test,\" where everyone must take a test to prove that they are not robots). He recounts a lonely man's visit to a strip club in the form of a five-hundred-word palindrome (\"Palindromes for Specific Occasions\"). And he examines the human condition (\"Human Cannonball Occupational Hazards\") and the competing world-views of divergent groups (\"Optimist, Pessimist, Contortionist\").Martin's material is varied, but his unique voice and brilliant mind will keep readers in stitches from beginning to end.",

Merwin acknowledges, \"I have just what I recall,\" and his recollections are sharp and vivid\u2014the unique properties of fall light, a talk with a childhood teacher, well-cultivated loves, and \"our long evenings and wonder.\" Merwin depicts a scene in \"Photographer\" in which \"someone who understood\" saves armloads of vintage glass negatives from a dumpcart. Merwin conjures up a boy laying in bed at night, listening to the muffled dynamite explosions of coal mining outside his house in \"Empty Lot,\" and we can't help but wonder: How shall we mine our lives?\u200d",

            "description": "At once a style guide, an inspirational tome, and a how-to volume on creating one's home, this book will serve as a go-to reference for all those seeking to spur their own creativity as they embark on the creation of home. When Diane Keaton decided that she wanted to build her own home from the ground up, she took the advice of her dear friend, film director Nancy Meyers, and took to the boards of Pinterest to find inspiration. There she discovered the practical and the fantastical, elements and styles long adored and ones that she never knew she was drawn to. Keaton's dream house was officially under way and this book that resulted is a compelling account of her that house, from idea to realization in brick, stone, and wood.\u200dThe House that Pinterest Built defines what home and house mean to the celebrated movie star, who is known for her love affair with houses and design. Filled with ideas that reveal a personal yet engaging aesthetic, this volume includes compelling photos from Keaton's past homes and those she admires, as well as a multitude of details from every corner of those spaces and objects that excite and inspire the house designer and dreamer--dramatic staircases and magical light fixtures, film stills and book covers, pottery and art--drawn from the visual treasure trove known as Pinterest and Keaton's private collection, as she creates and designs her newest house.Rich imagery is accompanied by Keaton's ideas for selecting furniture, kitchen layout, and bedroom design; she talks about the importance of lighting in the bathroom and why the living room needs to be reimagined. Beyond the interior, she explores curb appeal and environmental sensitivity, always with an eye to making home the way it should be--a place of tranquility, a place where one is restored and where one returns to dream again and again. The book culminates in the dream realized, the house she has imagined, designed, and made, now shared with the world for the first time in all-new photography.",

            "description": "Opening with a powerful and tender \u2018Ode to the Hymen\u2019, Sharon Olds uses this age-old poetic form to address many aspects of herself, in a collection that is centred around the female body and female pleasures, and touches along the way on parts of her own story which will be familiar from earlier works, each episode and memory now burnished by the wisdom and grace of looking back. In such poems as \u2018Ode to My Sister\u2019, \u2018Ode of Broken Loyalty\u2019, \u2018Ode to My Whiteness\u2019, \u2018Blow Job Ode\u2019, \u2018Ode to the Last 38 Trees in New York City Visible from This Window\u2019, Olds treats us to an intimate self-examination that, like all her work, is universal and by turns searing and charming in its honesty. From the early bodily joys and sorrows of her girlhood to the recent deaths of those dearest to her \u2013 the \u2018Sheffield Mountain Ode\u2019 for Galway Kinnell is one of the most stunning pieces here \u2013 Olds shapes her world in language that is startlingly fresh, profound in its conclusions, and life-giving for the reader.",

This pocket-sized book contains the most important poems in his dispensary: those that have repeatedly proven to be effective. There is something here to soothe your sorrow, whether you are suffering from loneliness, a lack of bravery, heartbreak, hopelessness, or even an excess of ego.\u200d",

While containing some of the most musical and unforgettable passages in twentieth-century poetry, its four parts, 'Burnt Norton', 'East Coker', 'The Dry Salvages' and 'Little Gidding', present a rigorous meditation on the spiritual, philosophical and personal themes which preoccupied the author. It was the way in which a private voice was heard to speak for the concerns of an entire generation, in the midst of war and doubt, that confirmed it as an enduring masterpiece.",

            "description": "In The Comedians, comedy historian Kliph Nesteroff brings to life a century of American comedy with real-life characters, forgotten stars, mainstream heroes, and counterculture iconoclasts. Based on over 200 original interviews and extensive archival research, Nesteroff's groundbreaking work is a narrative exploration of the way comedians have reflected, shaped, and changed American culture over the past 100 years.Starting with the vaudeville circuit at the turn of the last century, Nesteroff introduces the first stand-up comedian - an emcee who abandoned physical shtick for straight jokes. After the repeal of Prohibition, Mafia-run supper clubs replaced speakeasies, and mobsters replaced vaudeville impresarios as the comedian's primary employer. In the 1950s, the late-night talk show brought stand-up to a wide public, while Lenny Bruce, Mort Sahl, and Jonathan Winters attacked conformity and staged a comedy rebellion in coffeehouses. From comedy's part in the Civil Rights movement and the social upheaval of the late 1960s to the first comedy clubs of the 1970s and the cocaine-fueled comedy boom of the 1980s, The Comedians culminates with a new era of media-driven celebrity in the 21st century.",

            "description": "Billy Collins' poetry is characterized by a sense of whimsy, restraint, and wit. With his distinct style and approachable language, America's two-term Poet Laureate has opened the door to poetry for a large number of individuals who might otherwise be shut out. Collins' poems are full of mischief, comedy, and irony, just like the title of the collection.Collins demonstrates that excellent poetry does not have to be cryptic or incomprehensible via plain language, traits that are arguably the underlying problem with most \"serious\" poetry.Collins examines boyhood, jazz, love, the passage of time, and, of course, writing\u2014themes familiar to Collins's admirers but rendered fresh here\u2014in this bright new collection, his first in three years. Billy Collins' poetry is a window through which we observe our life as if for the first time. It is beautiful, hilarious, and incredibly empathic.",

            "description": "A Singular Exploration Of Modern Love And All Its Demons, In Words And Drawings.\u200dIn this brilliant gem of a book, artist/writer Leanne Shapton weaves together a voyeuristic tale of love and life through epigrammatic vignettes and sleek line drawings. Entire relationships are encapsulated in a few, stingingly perfect lines: \"Colleen was Walter's ex-girlfriend from med school. She loved to dance with men at weddings.\" Pricking our insecurities, Shapton introduces us to Kim, whose ex \"kept a drawerful of love letters in a kitchen drawer . . . She would stare at it while she cooked.\" And Ben's ex, \"a physiotherapist for the U.S. men's and women's Olympic swim teams. She wore small white shorts year-round.\"Fascinated by her own jealousy, Shapton interviewed acquaintances about their anxieties and peccadilloes, and the result is a book of surpassing originality: one of those unusual books that comes along to delight us all, like An Exaltation of Larks or Love, Loss, and What I Wore or Griffin and Sabine. Was She Pretty? can also share the shelf with the work of the legendary William Steig, whose early, psychologically revealing work inspired Shapton. An unflinching observer of human behavior, she invites us to peer into the hearts and minds of her characters--while reminding us that we shouldn't be surprised if we see ourselves staring right back.",

After filming was over, with Spielberg's cooperation, Gottlieb chronicled the extraordinary yearlong adventure in The Jaws Log, which was first published in 1975 and has sold more than two million copies. This expanded edition includes a photo section, an introduction by Benchley, and an afterword by Gottlieb that gives updates about the people and events involved in the film, ultimately providing a singular portrait of a famous movie and inspired moviemaking.",

Generously illustrated with over three hundred examples\u2014more than two hundred of which are in color\u2014the book charts significant topics including the arrival of mass-production; the birth of the art director; the appearance of the grid (and its subsequent rejection); the coming of non-print media; and the launch of the Macintosh computer and its ushering in of a new generation of designers enfranchised by digital technology.This revised edition of a fundamental work brings the story up to date with new text and images covering type on screen and, in particular, type for the internet. Combining an assessment of the culture of experimentation in contemporary typographic design alongside a clear presentation of the field\u2019s historical context, the book is an informed and accessible source for all students of design and for designers needing an expert overview of typography.",

            "description": "\"Mr. Jurgenson makes a first sortie toward a new understanding of the photograph, wherein artistry or documentary intent have given way to communication and circulation. Like Susan Sontag\u2019s On Photography, to which it self-consciously responds, The Social Photo is slim, hard-bitten and picture-free.\" \u2013 New York Times A set of bold theoretical reflections on how the social photo has remade our world.With the rise of the smart phone and social media, cameras have become ubiquitous, infiltrating nearly every aspect of social life. The glowing camera screen is the lens through which many of us seek to communicate our experience. But our thinking about photography has been slow to catch-up; this major fixture of everyday life is still often treated in the terms of art or journalism. In The Social Photo, social theorist Nathan Jurgenson develops bold new ways of understanding photography in the age of social media and the new kinds of images that have emerged: the selfie, the faux-vintage photo, the self-destructing image, the food photo. Jurgenson shows how these devices and platforms have remade the world and our understanding of ourselves within it.",

Berendt\u2019s book is alive with his experiences--living in Bali, studying at a Zen monastery in Kyoto, and encountering budding jazz stars in Indonesia, Japan, Europe, and the United States. Drawing from his friendships with composers and performers as well as his knowledge of new physics and Tantra, cybernetics, Sufism, and the works of Hermann Hesse, he reveals the importance of sound in shaping cultural and spiritual life worldwide.A tribute to the work of many of the greatest figures of our age--including Hans Kayser, Jean Gebser, Sufi Hazrat lnayat Khan, musicians John Coltrane and Ravi Shankar--Berendt\u2019s book suggests that hearing, rather than seeing, is the key to a more spiritual experience of consciousness. His discussion of sound in relation to mathematics, logic, sacred geometry, myth, and sexuality is practical as well as theoretical, offering readers a variety of techniques for developing the ear as an organ of spiritual perception.",

            "description": "For more than a decade, Clear and Simple as the Truth has guided readers to consider style not as an elegant accessory of effective prose but as its very heart. Francis-No\u00ebl Thomas and Mark Turner present writing as an intellectual activity, not a passive application of verbal skills. In classic style, the motive is truth, the purpose is presentation, the reader and writer are intellectual equals, and the occasion is informal. This general style of presentation is at home everywhere, from business memos to personal letters and from magazine articles to student essays. Everyone talks about style, but no one explains it. The authors of this book do; and in doing so, they provoke the reader to consider style, not as an elegant accessory of effective prose, but as its very heart.At a time when writing skills have virtually disappeared, what can be done? If only people learned the principles of verbal correctness, the essential rules, wouldn't good prose simply fall into place? Thomas and Turner say no. Attending to rules of grammar, sense, and sentence structure will no more lead to effective prose than knowing the mechanics of a golf swing will lead to a hole-in-one. Furthermore, ten-step programs to better writing exacerbate the problem by failing to recognize, as Thomas and Turner point out, that there are many styles with different standards.The book is divided into four parts. The first, \"Principles of Classic Style,\" defines the style and contrasts it with a number of others. \"The Museum\" is a guided tour through examples of writing, both exquisite and execrable. \"The Studio,\" new to this edition, presents a series of structured exercises. Finally, \"Further Readings in Classic Prose\" offers a list of additional examples drawn from a range of times, places, and subjects. A companion website, classicprose.com, offers supplementary examples, exhibits, and commentary, and features a selection of pieces written by students in courses that used Clear and Simple as the Truth as a textbook.",

            "description": "Emily Dickinson (1830-1886), the reclusive and intensely private poet saw only a few of her poems (she wrote well over a thousand) published during her life. After discovering a trove of manuscripts left in a wooden box, Dickinson\u2019s sister Lavinia, fortunately, chose to disobey Emily\u2019s wishes for her work to be burned after death. With the help of Amherst professors, Lavinia brought her sister\u2019s gifted verse into print. \u201cThe Collected Poems of Emily Dickinson\u201d brings together the first three series of her posthumous publications which debuted respectively in 1890, 1891, and 1896.It is here in this collection that we witness her poetic depth and range of style. The myth that surrounds Dickinson\u2019s life is enhanced by the ethereal quality of her poetry. Dickinson\u2019s idiom is as varied as her meter, and her unconventional use of punctuation, metaphor, and image make her an innovator of the lyric akin to many of the early modernists. These poems examine love, death, and nature with an effortless yet complex tone and voice. Now one of the most read and admired American poets, Dickinson\u2019s poetry deservedly continues to resonate with modern readers. This edition is printed on premium acid-free paper.",

            "description": "A keen typographic eye may help students and professionals in any creative industry. The Anatomy of Type (in the UK, The Geometry of Type) is all about looking at letters more attentively. You'll discover how to discern between related fonts and how letterform qualities (such as contrast, intricacy, and proportion) impact the mood, readability, and utility of each design through visual diagrams and practical descriptions. Aside from the nutritional content, the large-type spreads are also pleasing to the appearance.The author hand-selected the book's 100 fonts for their practicality and stylistic relevance in today's design world. You'll find current typefaces that are less prevalent \u2014 and frequently more helpful \u2014 than the overused classics, such as Garamond, Bodoni, Gill Sans, and Helvetica, among others.",

Remarkably, none of the founding members have told their story\u2014until now. Here, for the first time, the quiet one speaks.Lamont \u201cU-God\u201d Hawkins was born in Brownsville, New York, in 1970. Raised by a single mother and forced to reckon with the hostile conditions of project life, U-God learned from an early age how to survive. And surviving in New York City in the 1970s and 1980s was no easy task\u2014especially as a young black boy living in some of the city\u2019s most ignored and destitute districts. But, along the way, he met and befriended those who would eventually form the Clan\u2019s core: RZA, GZA, Method Man, Raekwon, Ol\u2019 Dirty Bastard, Inspectah Deck, Ghostface Killah, and Masta Killa. Brought up by the streets, and bonding over their love of hip-hop, they sought to pursue the impossible: music as their ticket out of the ghetto.U-God\u2019s unforgettable first-person account of his journey, from the streets of Brooklyn to some of the biggest stages around the world, is not only thoroughly affecting, unfiltered, and explosive but also captures, in vivid detail, the making of one of the greatest acts in American music history.",

            "description": "An insightful and essential new survey of Wyeth\u2019s entire career, situating the milestones of his art within the trajectory of 20th-century American life.This major retrospective catalogue explores the impact of time and place on the work of beloved American painter Andrew Wyeth (1917\u20132009). While previous publications have mainly analyzed Wyeth\u2019s work thematically, this publication places him fully in the context of the long 20th century, tracing his creative development from World War I through the new millennium.Published to coincide with the centenary of Wyeth\u2019s birth, the book looks at four major chronological periods in the artist\u2019s career: Wyeth as a product of the interwar years, when he started to form his own \u201cwar memories\u201d through military props and documentary photography he discovered in his father\u2019s art studio; the change from his \u201ctheatrical\u201d pictures of the 1940s to his own visceral responses to the landscape around Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, and his family\u2019s home in Maine; his sudden turn, in 1968, into the realm of erotic art, including a completely new assessment of Wyeth\u2019s \u201cHelga pictures\u201d\u2014a series of secret, nude depictions of his neighbor Helga Testorf\u2014within his career as a whole; and his late, self-reflective works, which includes the discussion of his previously unknown painting entitled Goodbye, now believed to be Wyeth\u2019s last work.",

            "description": "Mira Jacob's touching, often humorous, and utterly unique graphic memoir takes readers on her journey as a first-generation American. At an increasingly fraught time for immigrants and their families, Good Talk delves into the difficult conversations about race, sex, love, and family that seem to be unavoidable these days.Inspired by her popular BuzzFeed piece \"37 Difficult Questions from My Mixed-Raced Son,\" here are Jacob's responses to her six-year-old, Zakir, who asks if the new president hates brown boys like him; uncomfortable relationship advice from her parents, who came to the United States from India one month into their arranged marriage; and the imaginary therapy sessions she has with celebrities from Bill Murray to Madonna. Jacob also investigates her own past, from her memories of being the only non-white fifth grader to win a Daughters of the American Revolution essay contest to how it felt to be a brown-skinned New Yorker on 9/11. As earnest and moving as they are sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, these are the stories that have formed one American life.",

            "description": "Craftsmanship, says Richard Sennett, names the basic human impulse to do a job well for its own sake, and good craftsmanship involves developing skills and focusing on the work rather than ourselves. The computer programmer, the doctor, the artist, and even the parent and citizen all engage in a craftsman\u2019s work. In this thought-provoking book, Sennett explores the work of craftsmen past and present, identifies deep connections between material consciousness and ethical values, and challenges received ideas about what constitutes good work in today\u2019s world.\u200dThe Craftsman engages the many dimensions of skill\u2014from the technical demands to the obsessive energy required to do good work. Craftsmanship leads Sennett across time and space, from ancient Roman brickmakers to Renaissance goldsmiths to the printing presses of Enlightenment Paris and the factories of industrial London; in the modern world he explores what experiences of good work are shared by computer programmers, nurses and doctors, musicians, glassblowers, and cooks. Unique in the scope of his thinking, Sennett expands previous notions of crafts and craftsmen and apprises us of the surprising extent to which we can learn about ourselves through the labor of making physical things.",

Alfred R. Ferguson was founding editor of the edition, followed by Joseph Slater (until 1996)",

            "description": "New Yorker cartoonist Emily Flake relates the hilarious horrors of pregnancy, birth, and early parenting in this funny, poignant, and beautifully illustrated book.For most people, having a child doesn't go exactly as planned. Not many are willing to admit that not only did they dislike the early days of parenting, they sometimes hated it. MAMA TRIED is a relatable collection of cartoons and essays pertaining to the good, bad, and (very) ugly parenting experiences we all face. Subjects range from \"are you ready for children?\" to \"baby gear class-warfare.\" With incredible honesty, Flake tackles everything from morning sickness to sleep training, shedding much needed light on the gnarly realities of breastfeeding, child proofing, mommy groups, and every unrealistic expectation in between. MAMA TRIED will be an indispensable companion for sleepless parents and a fond reminder for those already out of the woods.",

            "description": "Here is the story of Jerry Weintraub: the self-made, Brooklyn-born, Bronx-raised impresario, Hollywood producer, legendary deal maker, and friend of politicians and stars. No matter where nature has placed him--the club rooms of Brooklyn, the Mafia dives of New York's Lower East Side, the wilds of Alaska, or the hills of Hollywood--he has found a way to put on a show and sell tickets at the door. \"All life was a theater and I wanted to put it up on a stage,\" he writes. \"I wanted to set the world under a marquee that read: 'Jerry Weintraub Presents.'\"In WHEN I STOP TALKING, YOU'LL KNOW I'M DEAD, we follow Weintraub from his first great success at age twenty-six with Elvis Presley, whom he took on the road with the help of Colonel Tom Parker; to the immortal days with Sinatra and Rat Pack glory; to his crowning hits as a movie producer, starting with Robert Altman and Nashville, continuing with Oh, God!, The Karate Kid movies, and Diner, among others, and summiting with Steven Soderbergh and Ocean's Eleven, Twelve, and Thirteen.Along the way, we'll watch as Jerry moves from the poker tables of Palm Springs (the games went on for days), to the power rooms of Hollywood, to the halls of the White House, to Red Square in Moscow and the Great Palace in Beijing-all the while counseling potentates, poets, and kings, with clients and confidants like George Clooney, Bruce Willis, George H. W. Bush, Armand Hammer, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Bob Dylan, Led Zeppelin, John Denver, Bobby Fischer . . .well, the list goes on forever.And of course, the story is not yet over . . .as the old-timers say, \"The best is yet to come.\"As Weintraub says, \"When I stop talking, you'll know I'm dead.\"With wit, wisdom, and the cool confidence that has colored his remarkable career, Jerry chronicles a quintessentially American journey, one marked by luck, love, and improvisation. The stories he tells and the lessons we learn are essential, not just for those who love movies and music, but for businessmen, entrepreneurs, artists . . . everyone.",

Helen Vendler closes the distance. She keeps the poet in view not only as thinker and artist, but as a man or woman whose humanity never disappears in her analysis. With her penetrating critical gift, Vendler assesses American poets from T. S. Eliot to Charles Wright.",

            "description": "An intimate, revealing look at one artist\u2019s journey from self-censorship to full expression.As one of the most celebrated musicians of our time, Alicia Keys has enraptured the nation with her heartfelt lyrics, extraordinary vocal range, and soul-stirring piano compositions. Yet away from the spotlight, Alicia has grappled with private heartache\u2015over the challenging and complex relationship with her father, the people-pleasing nature that characterized her early career, the loss of privacy surrounding her romantic relationships, and the oppressive expectations of female perfection.Since her rise to fame, Alicia\u2019s public persona has belied a deep personal truth: she has spent years not fully recognizing or honoring her own worth. After withholding parts of herself for so long, she is at last exploring the questions that live at the heart of her story: Who am I, really? And once I discover that truth, how can I become brave enough to embrace it.More Myself is part autobiography, part narrative documentary. Alicia\u2019s journey is revealed not only through her own candid recounting, but also through vivid recollections from those who have walked alongside her. The result is a 360-degree perspective on Alicia\u2019s path\u2015from her girlhood in Hell\u2019s Kitchen and Harlem, to the process of self-discovery she\u2019s still navigating.In More Myself, Alicia shares her quest for truth\u2015about herself, her past, and her shift from sacrificing her spirit to celebrating her worth. With the raw honesty that epitomizes Alicia\u2019s artistry, More Myself is at once a riveting account and a clarion call to readers: to define themselves in a world that rarely encourages a true and unique identity.",

Damned if I know, but give me a few minutes and I\u2019ll tell you whether you are.Thank heaven I don\u2019t have my friends\u2019 problems. But sometimes I notice an expression on one of their faces that I recognize as secret gratitude.I read sad stories to inoculate myself against grief. I watch action movies to identify with the quick-witted heroes. Both the same fantasy: I\u2019ll escape the worst of it.\u2015from 300 Arguments300 Arguments, a foray into the frontier of contemporary nonfiction writing, is at first glance a group of unrelated aphorisms. But, as in the work of David Markson, the pieces reveal themselves as a masterful arrangement that steadily gathers power. Manguso\u2019s arguments about desire, ambition, relationships, and failure are pithy, unsentimental, and defiant, and they add up to an unexpected and renegade wisdom literature.",

Glaser\u2019s work ranges from the psychedelic Bob Dylan poster to book and record covers; from store and restaurant design to toy creations; and magazine formats including New York magazine and logotypes, all of which define the look of our time. Here Glaser undertakes not only a remarkably wide-ranging representation of his oeuvre from the incredibly fertile early years, but, in a new introduction, speaks of the influences on his work, the responsibilities of the artist, the hierarchies of the traditional art world, and the role of graphic design in the area of his creative growth. First published in 1973, Milton Glaser: Graphic Design is an extraordinary achievement and indisputably a classic in the field.",

            "description": "By the time Goethe's \"Theory of Colours\" appeared in 1810, the wavelength theory of light and color had been firmly established. To Goethe, the theory was the result of mistaking an incidental result for an elemental principle. Far from pretending to a knowledge of physics, he insisted that such knowledge was an actual hindrance to understanding. He based his conclusions exclusively upon exhaustive personal observation of the phenomena of color.Of his own theory, Goethe was supremely confident: \"From the philosopher, we believe we merit thanks for having traced the phenomena of colours to their first sources, to the circumstances under which they appear and are, and beyond which no further explanation respecting them is possible.\"Goethe's scientific conclusions have, of course, long since been thoroughly demolished, but the intelligent reader of today may enjoy this work on quite different grounds: for the beauty and sweep of his conjectures regarding the connection between color and philosophical ideas; for an insight into early nineteenth-century beliefs and modes of thought; and for the flavor of life in Europe just after the American and French Revolutions.The work may also be read as an accurate guide to the study of color phenomena. Goethe's conclusions have been repudiated, but no one quarrels with his reporting of the facts to be observed. With simple objects -- vessels, prisms, lenses, and the like -- the reader will be led through a demonstration course not only in subjectively produced colors, but also in the observable physical phenomena of color. By closely following Goethe's explanations of the color phenomena, the reader may become so divorced from the wavelength theory -- Goethe never even mentions it -- that he may begin to think about color theory relatively unhampered by prejudice, ancient or modern.",

            "description": "Kitchen Table Series is the first publication dedicated solely to this early and important body of work by the American artist Carrie Mae Weems. The 20 photographs and 14 text panels that make up Kitchen Table Series tell a story of one woman's life, as conducted in the intimate setting of her kitchen. The kitchen, one of the primary spaces of domesticity and the traditional domain of women, frames her story, revealing to us her relationships--with lovers, children, friends--and her own sense of self, in her varying projections of strength, vulnerability, aloofness, tenderness and solitude. As Weems describes it, this work of art depicts -the battle around the family ... monogamy ... and between the sexes.- Weems herself is the protagonist of the series, though the woman she depicts is an archetype. Kitchen Table Series seeks to reposition and reimagine the possibility of women and the possibility of people of color, and has to do with, in the artist's words, -unrequited love.-",

            "description": "Andrey Tarkovsky, the genius of modern Russian cinema--hailed by Ingmar Bergman as \"the most important director of our time\"--died an exile in Paris in December 1986. In Sculpting in Time, he has left his artistic testament, a remarkable revelation of both his life and work. Since Ivan's Childhood won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1962, the visionary quality and totally original and haunting imagery of Tarkovsky's films have captivated serious movie audiences all over the world, who see in his work a continuation of the great literary traditions of nineteenth-century Russia. Many critics have tried to interpret his intensely personal vision, but he himself always remained inaccessible.In Sculpting in Time, Tarkovsky sets down his thoughts and his memories, revealing for the first time the original inspirations for his extraordinary films--Ivan's Childhood, Andrey Rublyov, Solaris, The Mirror, Stalker, Nostalgia, and The Sacrifice. He discusses their history and his methods of work, he explores the many problems of visual creativity, and he sets forth the deeply autobiographical content of part of his oeuvre--most fascinatingly in The Mirror and Nostalgia. The closing chapter on The Sacrifice, dictated in the last weeks of Tarkovsky's life, makes the book essential reading for those who already know or who are just discovering his magnificent work.",

Daddy and the brilliant, wild teacher, Miss Bathsheba, work to prepare Hushpuppy and his schoolmates for a life without grownups, a world where they must take care of each other. Tender, funny, and heartbreaking, Juicy and Delicious weaves a beautiful tale of loss, survival, and self-discovery.",

And it was her own personal journey that inspired Elle Luna to write a brief online manifesto that, in a few short months, has touched hundreds of thousands of people who\u2019ve read it or heard Elle speak on the topic. Now Ms. Luna expands her ideas into an inspirational, highly visual gift book for every recent graduate, every artist, every seeker, every career changer.The Crossroads of Should and Must has a universal message\u2014we get to choose the path between Should and Must. And it gives every reader permission to embrace this message. It\u2019s about the difference between jobs, careers, and callings. The difference between going to work and becoming one with your work. Why knowing what you want is often the hardest part. It gives eye-opening techniques for reconnecting with one\u2019s inner voice, like writing your own obituary (talk about putting life in perspective). It talks about the most common fears of choosing Must over Should\u2014money, time, space, and the ultimate fear: total vulnerability\u2014and shores up our hesitation with inspiring stories of and quotes from the artists and writers and thinkers who\u2019ve faced their own crossroads of Should and Must and taken the leap. It explains the importance of mistakes, of \u201cunlearning,\u201d of solitude, of keeping moving, of following a soul path.Presented in four chapters\u2014The Crossroads, The Origin of Should, Must, and The Return\u2014inspired by the hero\u2019s journey outlined by Joseph Campbell, The Crossroads of Should and Must guides us from the small moment, discovering our Must, to the big moment\u2014actually doing something about it, and returning to share our new gifts with the world.",

It is about the secrets of creative production and was first published in 1846. \"Most authors, especially poets, wish it to be recognized that they produce via a beautiful frenzy\u2014an ecstatic intuition...\" In addition, this edition includes a lengthy essay on Poe's life and career written in 1852 by French poet Charles Baudelaire (1821-1867). Henry Curwen (1845-1892) translated the essay into English in 1873.\u200d",

            "description": "War photographer Lynsey Addario\u2019s memoir It\u2019s What I Do is the story of how the relentless pursuit of truth, in virtually every major theater of war in the twenty-first century, has shaped her life. What she does, with clarity, beauty, and candor, is to document, often in their most extreme moments, the complex lives of others. It\u2019s her work, but it\u2019s much more than that: it\u2019s her singular calling.Lynsey Addario was just finding her way as a young photographer when September 11 changed the world. One of the few photojournalists with experience in Afghanistan, she gets the call to return and cover the American invasion. She makes a decision she would often find herself making\u2014not to stay home, not to lead a quiet or predictable life, but to set out across the world, face the chaos of crisis, and make a name for herself.Addario finds a way to travel with a purpose. She photographs the Afghan people before and after the Taliban reign, the civilian casualties and misunderstood insurgents of the Iraq War, as well as the burned villages and countless dead in Darfur. She exposes a culture of violence against women in the Congo and tells the riveting story of her headline-making kidnapping by pro-Qaddafi forces in the Libyan civil war.Addario takes bravery for granted but she is not fearless. She uses her fear and it creates empathy; it is that feeling, that empathy, that is essential to her work. We see this clearly on display as she interviews rape victims in the Congo, or photographs a fallen soldier with whom she had been embedded in Iraq, or documents the tragic lives of starving Somali children. Lynsey takes us there and we begin to understand how getting to the hard truth trumps fear.As a woman photojournalist determined to be taken as seriously as her male peers, Addario fights her way into a boys\u2019 club of a profession. Rather than choose between her personal life and her career, Addario learns to strike a necessary balance. In the man who will become her husband, she finds at last a real love to complement her work, not take away from it, and as a new mother, she gains an all the more intensely personal understanding of the fragility of life.Watching uprisings unfold and people fight to the death for their freedom, Addario understands she is documenting not only news but also the fate of society. It\u2019s What I Do is more than just a snapshot of life on the front lines; it is witness to the human cost of war.",

            "description": "Jacqueline Woodson, one of today's finest writers, tells the moving story of her childhood in mesmerizing verse.Raised in South Carolina and New York, Woodson always felt halfway home in each place. In vivid poems, she shares what it was like to grow up as an African American in the 1960s and 1970s, living with the remnants of Jim Crow and her growing awareness of the Civil Rights movement. Touching and powerful, each poem is both accessible and emotionally charged, each line a glimpse into a child\u2019s soul as she searches for her place in the world. Woodson\u2019s eloquent poetry also reflects the joy of finding her voice through writing stories, despite the fact that she struggled with reading as a child. Her love of stories inspired her and stayed with her, creating the first sparks of the gifted writer she was to become.",

Naomi Shihab Nye says of this book, \"Aimee Nezhukumatathil's poems are . . . ripe, funny and fresh. They're the fullness of days, deliciously woven of heart and verve, rich with sources and elements-animals, insects, sugar, cardamom, legends, countries, relatives, soaps, fruits-taste and touch. I love the nubby layerings of lines, luscious textures and constructions. . . . She knows that many worlds may live in one house. . . .\"",

Collected here for the first time, these lectures include \"Poetry and the Moon,\" \"Someone Reading a Book Is a Sign of Order in the World,\" and \"Lectures I Will Never Give.\" Intellectually virtuosic, instructive, and experiential, Madness, Rack, and Honey resists definition, demanding instead an utter\u2014and utterly pleasurable\u2014immersion. Finalist for the 2012 National Book Critics Circle Award.",

There isn't even an introduction to this book.As he ponders the most basic of drives (\"Why does man kill? \"), Woody Allen displays various aspects of himself in The Insanity Defense. He murders for the sake of food. And not only for food: there must frequently be a beverage\"); considers death (\"I don't believe in an afterlife, but I am carrying a change of underpants\"); and considers the impact of novelty chewing gum, the dribbling glass, and other novelties on history. \u00a0\u201cThe food went down the wrong pipe, and choking occurred. Grasping the mouse firmly by the tail, I snapped it like a small whip, and the morsel of cheese came loose. If we can transfer the procedure to humans, we may have something. Too early to tell.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0says one amazing story about the fruitless race to beat Dr. Heimlich to the punch.\u00a0Fans of Woody Allen will like this hilarious collection, and those who don't love The Insanity Defense are just insane.",

            "description": "An intimate portrayal of a great filmmaker, theatre director, and comedian, based on open discussions with some of his closest friends in show business and the arts, including Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep, Natalie Portman, and Lorne Michaels.From The Graduate and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? through Angels in America, The Birdcage, Working Girl, and Primary Colors, not to mention his run of blockbuster plays like Barefoot in the Park and The Odd Couple, Mike Nichols' work penetrates American cultural awareness. Not only that, but he was also a founding member of the first improv ensemble and one half of the legendary comedy team Nichols & May. Mike Nichols permanently revolutionized Hollywood, Broadway, and humor over his half-century career.The majority of admirers, on the other hand, know virtually little about the person behind it all. They have little sense of his searching intellect or devastating wit because he never wrote his memoirs and rarely appeared on television. They are unaware that Nichols, the great American director, was born Mikail Igor Peschkowsky in Berlin and fled the Nazis by coming to this country without knowing English. They had no idea that Nichols was once a lone psychology student or that a childhood sickness had long-term, life-altering consequences. They have no idea that he went into a deep depression before marrying Diane Sawyer\u00a0and \"finally getting it right,\" as he put it.For the first time, Ash Carter and Sam Kashner provide an intimate glimpse behind the scenes of Nichols' life, as revealed by the actors, moguls, writers, producers, comedy, and crewmembers who remained faithful to him for years. Life Isn't Everything is a mosaic picture of a bright and innovative filmmaker noted for his extraordinary charm, humor, vigor, and knack for friendship; it's also a snapshot of what it was like to live, love, and make art in the twentieth century.\u200d",

They'll go to any length to photograph gorgeous scenery, wildlife, and people in the correct light. Exotic locations, on the other hand, aren't required for fascinating images. Wonderful photographs may be found practically anywhere; all you have to do is know where to look.Extraordinary Everyday Photography will guide you beyond the obvious to discover the unexpected wherever you are, whether it's a city street, a neighborhood park, or your own front yard. Brenda Tharp and Jed Manwaring, the authors, advise amateur photographers to slow down, open their eyes, and respond to what they see in order to generate captivating, non-overworked photographs. The writers' inspiring photo samples, shot with DSLRs, small digital cameras, and even iPhones, demonstrate that a wonderful image is created by the photographer's eye and creative vision, not the gear.",

Quincy Jones, Diane Keaton, Gloria Steinem, Julia Roberts, John Cleese and David Bowie are just a few of his celebrity alumni. Writers, producers, development executives and agents all flock to his lecture series, praising it as a mesmerizing and intense learning experience. In Story, McKee expands on the concepts he teaches in his $450 seminars (considered a must by industry insiders), providing readers with the most comprehensive, integrated explanation of the craft of writing for the screen. No one better understands how all the elements of a screenplay fit together, and no one is better qualified to explain the \"magic\" of story construction and the relationship between structure and character than Robert McKee.",

            "description": "\"I believe that the reader will discover here the essential nature of one of the strangest and most awful chapters in human history,\" Arthur Miller wrote of his classic play about the witch-hunts and trials in seventeenth-century Salem, Massachusetts. Based on historical people and real events, Miller's drama is a searing portrait of a community engulfed by hysteria. In the rigid theocracy of Salem, rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town's most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch, self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminates the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence.Written in 1953, The Crucible is a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy's \"witch-hunts\" in the United States. Within the text itself, Miller contemplates the parallels, writing, \"Political opposition... is given an inhumane overlay, which then justifies the abrogation of all normally applied customs of civilized behavior. A political policy is equated with moral right, and opposition to it with diabolical malevolence.\"",

            "description": "Actors have been seen as keepers of intuitive wisdom in traditional communities across the world for thousands of years, and the actor's route has been a path to knowledge and power. Brian Bates feels that this is still the case today, that actors and actresses serve as modern-day seers and shamans in our culture. He presents the actor as a visionary who sweeps viewers out of their everyday lives and guides them on a voyage of self-discovery. Personal charm and attraction, acute bodily awareness, and psychic sensitivity are just a few of the extraordinary abilities that add to the actor's mystique.The author draws on extensive research in science, psychology, parapsychology, and Eastern and Western mysticism to explore the significance of dramatic art, citing the observations and experiences of more than thirty famous actors, including Meryl Streep, Marlon Brando, Glenda Jackson, Liv Ullmann, Jack Nicholson, and Shirley MacLaine. He not only demonstrates how the beautiful world of theatre and screen reflects our lives, but he also demonstrates how actors and actresses pave the path to self-transformation for everybody. For, he states, \"the way of the actor is not an esoteric discipline divorced from everyday life. It is everyday life, heightened and lived to the full, with an awareness of powers beyond understanding.\"",

            "description": "A new collection from David Sedaris is cause for jubilation. His recent move to Paris has inspired hilarious pieces, including Me Talk Pretty One Day, about his attempts to learn French. His family is another inspiration. You Cant Kill the Rooster is a portrait of his brother who talks incessant hip-hop slang to his bewildered father. And no one hones a finer fury in response to such modern annoyances as restaurant meals presented in ludicrous towers and cashiers with 6-inch fingernails.Compared by The New Yorker to Twain and Hawthorne, Sedaris has become one of our best-loved authors. Sedaris is an amazing reader whose appearances draw hundreds, and his performances including a jaw-dropping impression of Billie Holiday singing I wish I were an Oscar Meyer weinerare unforgettable. Sedariss essays on living in Paris are some of the funniest he's ever written. At last, someone even meaner than the French! The sort of blithely sophisticated, loopy humour that might have resulted if Dorothy Parker and James Thurber had had a love child. Entertainment Weekly on Barrel Fever Sidesplitting Not one of the essays in this new collection failed to crack me up; frequently I was helpless. The New York Times Book Review on Naked",

Featuring hundreds of powerful art works in 60 cities \u2013 from Albuquerque to Boston and Baja to Rio de Janeiro \u2013 the book is both an informative guide and a virtual bucket list of outstanding art destinations.Conceived and developed by Phaidon editors, Art & Place covers carving, painting, murals, frescos, earthworks, land art, and more. Each of the works has a dedicated entry pairing gorgeous, large-format images with in&hyphen;depth descriptions. Maps pinpoint the sites\u2019 locations while specially commissioned plans reveal some of the more complex layouts. The book is organized geographically, offering fresh juxtapositions among familiar art works, such as Anish Kapoor\u2019s Cloud Gate and Robert Smithson\u2019s Spiral Jetty, alongside lesser-known revelations, such as Inhotim Centro de Arte Contempor\u00e2nea in Brazil. Whether in the mountains, at the heart of a city, or on a remote island, the works in Art & Place are all inextricably linked with their environment. This is art to experience in an immersive way, presented together in a single book for the first time.",

            "description": "Washington Post staff writer Geoff Edgers takes a deep dive into the story behind \"Walk This Way,\" Aerosmith and Run-DMC's legendary, groundbreaking mashup that forever changed music.The early 1980s were an exciting time for music. Hair metal bands were selling out stadiums, while clubs and house parties in New York City has spawned a new genre of music. At the time, though, hip hop's reach was limited, an artform largely ignored by mainstream radio deejays and the rock-obsessed MTV network.But in 1986, the music world was irrevocably changed when Run-DMC covered Aerosmith's hit \"Walk This Way\" in the first rock-hip hop collaboration. Other had tried melding styles. This was different, as a pair of iconic arena rockers and the young kings of hip hop shared a studio and started a revolution. The result: Something totally new and instantly popular. Most importantly, \"Walk This Way\" would be the first rap song to be played on mainstream rock radio.In Walk This Way, Geoff Edgers sets the scene for this unlikely union of rockers and MCs, a mashup that both revived Aerosmith and catapulted hip hop into the mainstream. He tracks the paths of the main artists--Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, Joseph \"Run\" Simmons, and Darryl \"DMC\" McDaniels--along with other major players on the scene across their lives and careers, illustrating the long road to the revolutionary marriage of rock and hip hop. Deeply researched and written in cinematic style, this music history is a must-read for fans of hip hop, rock, and everything in between.",

As three worlds collide, a mother's Philippines, a father's India and the poet's contemporary America, the resulting impressions are chronicled in this collection of incisive and penetrating verse.

We Are the Ones We Have Been Waiting For takes on some of the greatest challenges of our times and in it Walker encourages readers to take faith in the fact that, despite the daunting predicaments we find ourselves in, we are uniquely prepared to create positive change.The hardcover edition of We Are the Ones We Have Been Waiting For included a national tour that saw standing-room\u2013only crowds and standing ovations. Walker\u2019s clear vision and calm meditative voice\u2014truly \"a light in darkness\"\u2014has struck a deep chord among a large and devoted readership.",

            "description": "The Country Between Us begins with a collection of poems on El Salvador, where Carolyn Forch\u00e9 worked as a journalist in the late 1970s and was deeply immersed in the country's political fight. Other poems by Forch\u00e9 are similarly intimate, urgent, and affecting. The picture of a compassionate, bold, and active young woman who has made her life a trip may be the end impression of her poems. She's been to a lot of places, as these poems show, but she also has the feeling of someone who is \"coming from far and going far,\" as Ignazio Silone puts it.",

Rilke's best work has been gathered by John J. L. Mood, who has included discussion with the selections. Rilke's great comprehension of men and women, as well as his intense spirituality anchored in the senses, are shown in Mood, which incorporates excerpts from letters into an essay.The poetry on love offered here are typically not simply sensual but often sexual, combining passion and compassion. Others look for recurring themes in his work, such as death and life, as well as progress and evolution. Rilke's comments on knowledge and openness to experience, on grasping the most difficult and converting the most strange into that which we can most trust, finish the book.",

His discussions of diction, syntax, tone, meaning, composition, and revision guide the reader through the technique of making the written word clear and agreeable to read. Exercises, model passages both literary and casual, and hundreds of amusing examples of usage gone wrong show how to choose the right path to self-expression in forceful and distinctive words.",

            "description": "In the citation accompanying Kay's recent award of the prestigious Ruth Lilly Prize, Christine Wiman wrote: \"Kay Ryan can take any subject and make it her own. Her poems-which combine extreme concision and formal expertise with broad subjects and deep feeling-could never be mistaken for anyone else's. Her work has the kind of singularity and sustained integrity that are very, very rare\u2026. It's always a dicey business predicting the literary future\u2026[but] for this reader, these poems feel as if there were built to last, and\u2026they have the passion, precision and sheer weirdness to do so.\"Salon compared the poems in Ryan's last collection to \"Faberg\u00e9 eggs, tiny, ingenious devices that inevitably conceal some hidden wonder.\" The exquisite poems in The Niagara River provide similarly hidden gems. Bafflingly effective, they seem too brief and blithe to pack so much wallop. Intense and relaxed at once, both buoyant and rueful, their singular music appeals to many people. Her poems, products of an immaculately off-kilter mind, have been featured everywhere from the Sunday funnies to New York subways to plaques at the zoo to the pages of The New Yorker.",

            "description": "Twenty-five years after her classic On Photography, Susan Sontag returns to the subject of visual representations of war and violence in our culture today. How does the spectacle of the sufferings of others (via television or newspapers) affect us? Are viewers inured--or incited--to violence by the depiction of crueltyIn Regarding the Pain of Others, Sontag takes a fresh look at the representation of atrocity--from Goya's The Disasters of War to photographs of the American Civil War, lynchings of blacks in the South, and the Nazi death camps, to contemporary horrific images of Bosnia, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Israel and Palestine, and New York City on September 11, 2001. In Regarding the Pain of Others Susan Sontag once again changes the way we think about the uses and meanings of images in our world, and offers an important reflection about how war itself is waged (and understood) in our time.Features an analysis of our numbed response to images of horror. This title alters our thinking about the uses and meanings of images, and about the nature of war, the limits of sympathy, and the obligations of conscience.",

It is the chronicle of a girlhood and adolescence at once outrageous and familiar, a young life entwined with the history of her country yet filled with the universal trials and joys of growing up.Edgy, searingly observant, and candid, often heartbreaking but threaded throughout with raw humor and hard-earned wisdom--Persepolis is a stunning work from one of the most highly regarded, singularly talented graphic artists at work today.",

Eddie's outlandish fantasies and metafictional tricks convert life into art, while staying fully grounded in his own absurdity.This Life-Size Omnibus edition of ALEC includes all the stories from The King Canute Crowd, Three-Piece Suit, How to be an Artist, and After the Snooter, as well as the very early, out-of-print ALEC stories and a staggering amount of bonus material.",

            "description": "This book is about how type should look and how to make it look that way; in other words, how to set type like a professional. It releases the craft knowledge that used to reside almost exclusively in the heads of people working in type shops. The shops are gone, the technologies have changed, but the goal remains the same. This book explains in very practical terms how to use today's computerized tools to achieve that secret of good design: well-set type.Beautifully designed and richly illustrated, The Complete Manual of Typography is an essential reference for anyone who works with type. Designers, print production professionals, and corporate communications managers can go straight to the index to find focused answers to specific questions, while educators and students can read it as a textbook from cover to cover. You'll find:History, basic concepts, and anatomy of good typography, concisely presented and indexed for quick reference by busy professionals. Straight-ahead instructions for how to manage fonts, handle corrupted or missing fonts, and find the characters you need. Clear, useful explanations of what makes good type good (and bad type bad) . Detailed guidance on controlling the fundamentals of type, including measure, point size, leading, kerning, and hyphenation and justification. Practical advice on how to fix and avoid composition problems such as loose lines, bad rags, widows and orphans. Hard-to-find rules for managing indents and alignments, skews, wraps, expert-set characters, and tables. Scores of workarounds that show how to wring good type out of uncooperative word-processing and layout programs.",

            "description": "An enduring collection of revolutionary comics from a genre-transforming and critically acclaimed cartoonistJulie Doucet arrived in comics in the 1990s as a fully formed cartoonist. Her comic book series Dirty Plotte was visionary both for the medium and for storytelling. Her stories are candid, funny and intimate, plumbing the depths of the female psyche while charting the fragility of the men around her. Her artwork is dense and confident, never wavering in the wit and humour of its owner. Doucet was active in comics for fifteen years before she moved on to other mediums. Her influence casts a long shadow over the medium, Dirty Plotte is quite simply one of the most iconic comic book series to have ever been created.Dirty Plotte: The Complete Julie Doucet collects the entire comic book series, including the acclaimed My New York Diary, as well as rare comics and previously unpublished material; a reproduction of the first Dirty Plotte mini comic; essays about her comics legacy and feminist influence by curator Dan Nadel and academic Martine Delvaux respectively; an interview by comics scholar Christian Gasser; and personal anecdotes from Jami Attenberg, Adrian Tomine, and more.Doucet uses the covers of this two-book box set to present an all-new comic that explores her complicated relationship with femininity and the importance of her relationships with female readers. Astonishingly honest, brutal, and funny, Dirty Plotte is a revelatory journey into a legendary cartoonist\u2019s oeuvre.",

This revision includes the full texts of Part I of the original, on the Las Vegas strip, and Part II, \"Ugly and Ordinary Architecture, or the Decorated Shed,\" a generalization from the findings of the first part on symbolism in architecture and the iconography of urban sprawl. (The final part of the first edition, on the architectural work of the firm Venturi and Rauch, is not included in the revision.)",

            "description": "James Baldwin was a uniquely prophetic voice in American letters. His brilliant and provocative essays made him the literary voice of the Civil Rights Era, and they continue to speak with powerful urgency to us today, whether in the swirling debate over the Black Lives Matter movement or in the words of Raoul Peck's documentary \"I Am Not Your Negro.\" Edited by Nobel laureate Toni Morrison, the Library of America's Collected Essays is the most comprehensive gathering of Baldwin's nonfiction ever published.With burning passion and jabbing, epigrammatic wit, Baldwin fearlessly articulated issues of race and democracy and American identity in such famous essays as \"The Harlem Ghetto,\" \"Everybody's Protest Novel,\" \"Many Thousands Gone,\" and \"Stranger in the Village.\" Here are the complete texts of his early landmark collections, Notes of a Native Son (1955) and Nobody Knows My Name (1961), which established him as an essential intellectual voice of his time, fusing in unique fashion the personal, the literary, and the political. \"One writes,\" he stated, \"out of one thing only\u2014one's own experience. Everything depends on how relentlessly one forces from this experience the last drop, sweet or bitter, it can possibly give.\" With singular eloquence and unblinking sharpness of observation he lived up to his credo: \"I want to be an honest man and a good writer.\"The classic The Fire Next Time (1963), perhaps the most influential of his writings, is his most penetrating analysis of America's racial divide and an impassioned call to \"end the racial nightmare...and change the history of the world.\" The later volumes No Name in the Street (1972) and The Devil Finds Work (1976) chart his continuing response to the social and political turbulence of his era and include his remarkable works of film criticism. A further 36 essays\u2014nine of them previously uncollected\u2014include some of Baldwin's earliest published writings, as well as revealing later insights into the language of Shakespeare, the poetry of Langston Hughes, and the music of Earl Hines.",

Gioia has published five volumes of poetry, served as the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, and currently sits as the Poet Laureate of California, but he is also a graduate of Stanford Business School and was once a Vice President at General Foods. He has studied opera and is a published librettist, in addition to his prolific work in critical essay writing and editing literary anthologies. Having lived several lives, Gioia brings an insightful, varied, eclectic eye to this year\u2019s Best American Poetry.With his classic essay \u201cCan Poetry Matter?\u201d, originally run in The Atlantic in 1991, Gioia considered whether there is a place for poetry to be a part of modern American mainstream culture. Decades later, the debate continues, but Best American Poetry 2018 stands as evidence that poetry is very much present, relevant, and finding new readers.",

            "description": "Many famed music producers are known for a particular sound that has its day. Rick Rubin is known for something else: creating a space where artists of all different genres and traditions can home in on who they really are and what they really offer. He has made a practice of helping people transcend their self-imposed expectations in order to reconnect with a state of innocence from which the surprising becomes inevitable. Over the years, as he has thought deeply about where creativity comes from and where it doesn\u2019t, he has learned that being an artist isn\u2019t about your specific output, it\u2019s about your relationship to the world. Creativity has a place in everyone\u2019s life, and everyone can make that place larger. In fact, there are few more important responsibilities.\u200dThe Creative Act is a beautiful and generous course of study that illuminates the path of the artist as a road we all can follow. It distills the wisdom gleaned from a lifetime\u2019s work into a luminous reading experience that puts the power to create moments\u2014and lifetimes\u2014of exhilaration and transcendence within closer reach for all of us.",
