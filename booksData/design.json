            "description": "Based on more than forty interviews with Jobs conducted over two years\u2014as well as interviews with more than a hundred family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues\u2014Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing.At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, and when societies around the world are trying to build digital-age economies, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.Driven by demons, Jobs could drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and products were interrelated, just as Apple\u2019s hardware and software tended to be, as if part of an integrated system. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.",

It is, at heart, a book about how to build a creative culture\u2014but it is also, as Pixar co-founder and president Ed Catmull writes, \u201can expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.\u201dFor nearly twenty years, Pixar has dominated the world of animation, producing such beloved films as the Toy Story trilogy, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Up, and WALL-E, which have gone on to set box-office records and garner thirty Academy Awards. The joyousness of the storytelling, the inventive plots, the emotional authenticity: In some ways, Pixar movies are an object lesson in what creativity really is. Here, in this book, Catmull reveals the ideals and techniques that have made Pixar so widely admired\u2014and so profitable.As a young man, Ed Catmull had a dream: to make the first computer-animated movie. He nurtured that dream as a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah, where many computer science pioneers got their start, and then forged a partnership with George Lucas that led, indirectly, to his founding Pixar with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter in 1986. Nine years later, Toy Story was released, changing animation forever. The essential ingredient in that movie\u2019s success\u2014and in the thirteen movies that followed\u2014was the unique environment that Catmull and his colleagues built at Pixar, based on philosophies that protect the creative process and defy convention.",

The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization.The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time.The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how -- and why -- some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.",

He wrote the book he wished had been available to him as a start-up founder\u2014not abstract theory, but a how-to guide for building better products. Hooked is written for product managers, designers, marketers, start-up founders, and anyone who seeks to understand how products influence our behavior.Eyal provides readers with:Practical insights to create user habits that stick.Actionable steps for building products people love.Fascinating examples from the iPhone to Twitter, Pinterest to the Bible App, and many other habit-forming products.",

            "description": "The #1 New York Times bestselling biography of how Steve Jobs became the most visionary CEO in history. \u00a0Becoming Steve Jobs breaks down the conventional, one-dimensional view of Steve Jobs that he was half-genius, half-jerk from youth, an irascible and selfish leader who slighted friends and family alike. Becoming Steve Jobs answers the central question about the life and career of the Apple cofounder and CEO: How did a young man so reckless and arrogant that he was exiled from the company he founded become the most effective visionary business leader of our time, ultimately transforming the daily life of billions of people?Drawing on incredible and sometimes exclusive access, Schlender and Tetzeli tell a different story of a real human being who wrestled with his failings and learned to maximize his strengths over time. Their rich, compelling narrative is filled with stories never told before from the people who knew Jobs best, including his family, former inner circle executives, and top people at Apple, Pixar and Disney, most notably Tim Cook, Jony Ive, Eddy Cue, Ed Catmull, John Lasseter, Robert Iger and many others. In addition, Schlender knew Jobs personally for 25 years and draws upon his many interviews with him, on and off the record, in writing the book. He and Tetzeli humanize the man and explain, rather than simply describe, his behavior.Along the way, the book provides rich context about the technology revolution we've all lived through, and the ways in which Jobs changed our worldA rich and revealing account, Becoming Steve Jobs shows us how one of the most colorful and compelling figures of our times was able to combine his unchanging, relentless passion with an evolution in management style to create one of the most valuable and beloved companies on the planet.",

And it\u2019s still short, profusely illustrated\u2026and best of all\u2013fun to read.If you\u2019ve read it before, you\u2019ll rediscover what made Don\u2019t Make Me Think so essential to Web designers and developers around the world. If you\u2019ve never read it, you\u2019ll see why so many people have said it should be required reading for anyone working on Web sites.\u201cAfter reading it over a couple of hours and putting its ideas to work for the past five years, I can say it has done more to improve my abilities as a Web designer than any other book.\u201d \u2013Jeffrey Zeldman, author of Designing with Web Standards",

Make your choice.What do Starbucks and JetBlue and KrispyKreme and Apple and DutchBoy and Kensington and Zespri and Hard Candy have that you don't? How do they continue to confound critics and achieve spectacular growth, leaving behind former tried-and true brands to gasp their last?Face it, the checklist of tired 'P's marketers have used for decades to get their product noticed - Pricing, Promotion, Publicity, to name a few - aren't working anymore. There's an exceptionally important 'P' that has to be added to the list. It's Purple Cow.Cows, after you've seen one, or two, or ten, are boring. A Purple Cow, though...now that would be something. Purple Cow describes something phenomenal, something counterintuitive and exciting and flat out unbelievable. Every day, consumers come face to face with a lot of boring stuff-a lot of brown cows - but you can bet they won't forget a Purple Cow. And it's not a marketing function that you can slap on to your product or service. Purple Cow is inherent. It's built right in, or it's not there. Period.In Purple Cow, Seth Godin urges you to put a Purple Cow into everything you build, and everything you do, to create something truly noticeable. It's a manifesto for marketers who want to help create products that are worth marketing in the first place.",

            "description": "At the core of A Pattern Language is the philosophy that in designing their environments people always rely on certain \u2018languages,\u2019 which, like the languages we speak, allow them to articulate and communicate an infinite variety of designs within a formal system which gives them coherence.This book provides a language of this kind. It will enable making a design for almost any kind of building, or any part of the built environment. \u2018Patterns,\u2019 the units of this language, are answers to design problems: how high should a window sill be?; how many stories should a building have?; how much space in a neighborhood should be devoted to grass and trees?More than 250 of the patterns in this language are outlined, each consisting of a problem statement, a discussion of the problem with an illustration, and a solution. As the authors say in their introduction, many of the patterns are archetypal, so deeply rooted in the nature of things that it seems likely that they will be a part of human nature and human action as much in five hundred years as they are today.\u200dA Pattern Language is related to Alexander\u2019s other works in the Center for Environmental Structure series: The Timeless Way of Building (introductory volume) and The Oregon Experiment.",

How Buildings Learn is a masterful new synthesis that proposes that buildings adapt best when constantly refined and reshaped by their occupants, and that architects can mature from being artists of space to becoming artists of time.From the connected farmhouses of New England to I.M. Pei's Media Lab, from \"satisficing\" to \"form follows funding,\" from the evolution of bungalows to the invention of Santa Fe Style, from Low Road military surplus buildings to a High Road English classic like Chatsworth\u2014this is a far-ranging survey of unexplored essential territory.More than any other human artifacts, buildings improve with time\u2014if they're allowed to. How Buildings Learn shows how to work with time rather than against it.",

Now, in an even more forward-thinking and necessary book, he shows how to take that critical next step on a creative journey\u2015getting known.Show Your Work! is about why generosity trumps genius. It\u2019s about getting findable, about using the network instead of wasting time \u201cnetworking.\u201d It\u2019s not self-promotion, it\u2019s self-discovery\u2015let others into your process, then let them steal from you. Filled with illustrations, quotes, stories, and examples, Show Your Work! offers ten transformative rules for being open, generous, brave, productive.In chapters such as You Don\u2019t Have to Be a Genius; Share Something Small Every Day; and Stick Around, Kleon creates a user\u2019s manual for embracing the communal nature of creativity\u2015 what he calls the \u201cecology of talent.\u201d From broader life lessons about work (you can\u2019t find your voice if you don\u2019t use it) to the etiquette of sharing\u2015and the dangers of oversharing\u2015to the practicalities of Internet life (build a good domain name; give credit when credit is due), it\u2019s an inspiring manifesto for succeeding as any kind of artist or entrepreneur in the digital age.",

Business owners and investors want their companies and the people who lead them to be equipped to answer these questions\u2014and quickly. And now there\u2019s a sure-fire way to solve their problems and test solutions: the sprint.While working at Google, designer Jake Knapp created a unique problem-solving method that he coined a \u201cdesign sprint\u201d\u2014a five-day process to help companies answer crucial questions. His \u2018sprints\u2019 were used on everything from Google Search to Chrome to Google X. When he moved to Google Ventures, he joined Braden Kowitz and John Zeratsky, both designers and partners there who worked on products like YouTube and Gmail.

Designing without understanding what makes people act the way they do is like exploring a new city without a map: results will be haphazard, confusing, and inefficient. This book combines real science and research with practical examples to deliver a guide every designer needs. With it you'll be able to design more intuitive and engaging work for print, websites, applications, and products that matches the way people think, work, and play.Learn to increase the effectiveness, conversion rates, and usability of your own design projects by finding the answers to questions such as:What grabs and holds attention on a page or screen?What makes memories stick?What is more important, peripheral or central vision?How can you predict the types of errors that people will make?What is the limit to someone's social circle?How do you motivate people to continue on to (the next step?What line length for text is best?Are some fonts better than others?These are just a few of the questions that the book answers in its deep-dive exploration of what makes people tick.",

Creative Selection recounts the life of one of the few who worked behind the scenes, a highly-respected software engineer who worked in the final years of the Steve Jobs era\u2015the Golden Age of Apple.Ken Kocienda offers an inside look at Apple\u2019s creative process. For fifteen years, he was on the ground floor of the company as a specialist, directly responsible for experimenting with novel user interface concepts and writing powerful, easy-to-use software for products including the iPhone, the iPad, and the Safari web browser. His stories explain the symbiotic relationship between software and product development for those who have never dreamed of programming a computer, and reveal what it was like to work on the cutting edge of technology at one of the world's most admired companies.Kocienda shares moments of struggle and success, crisis and collaboration, illuminating each with lessons learned over his Apple career. He introduces the essential elements of innovation\u2015inspiration, collaboration, craft, diligence, decisiveness, taste, and empathy\u2015and uses these as a lens through which to understand productive work culture.An insider's tale of creativity and innovation at Apple, Creative Selection shows readers how a small group of people developed an evolutionary design model, and how they used this methodology to make groundbreaking and intuitive software which countless millions use every day.",

            "description": "From the winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, Richard H. Thaler, and Cass R. Sunstein: a revelatory look at how we make decisions\u2014for fans of Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s Blink and Daniel Kahneman\u2019s Thinking, Fast and Slow.More than 1.5 million copies soldNew York Times bestsellerNamed a Best Book of the Year by The Economist and the Financial TimesEvery day we make choices\u2014about what to buy or eat, about financial investments or our children\u2019s health and education, even about the causes we champion or the planet itself. Unfortunately, we often choose poorly. Nudge is about how we make these choices and how we can make better ones. Using dozens of eye-opening examples and drawing on decades of behavioral science research, Nobel Prize winner Richard H. Thaler and Harvard Law School professor Cass R. Sunstein show that no choice is ever presented to us in a neutral way, and that we are all susceptible to biases that can lead us to make bad decisions. But by knowing how people think, we can use sensible \u201cchoice architecture\u201d to nudge people toward the best decisions for ourselves, our families, and our society, without restricting our freedom of choice.",

Munari insisted that design be beautiful, functional and accessible, and this enlightening and highly entertaining book sets out his ideas about visual, graphic and industrial design and the role it plays in the objects we use everyday. Lamps, road signs, typography, posters, children's books, advertising, cars and chairs - these are just some of the subjects to which he turns his illuminating gaze.",

            "description": "From Neal Gabler, the definitive portrait of one of the most important figures in twentieth-century American entertainment and cultural history.Seven years in the making and meticulously researched\u2014Gabler is the first writer to be given complete access to the Disney archives\u2014this is the full story of a man whose work left an ineradicable brand on our culture but whose life has largely been enshrouded in myth.Gabler shows us the young Walt Disney breaking free of a heartland childhood of discipline and deprivation and making his way to Hollywood. We see the visionary, whose desire for escape honed an innate sense of what people wanted to see on the screen and, when combined with iron determination and obsessive perfectionism, led him to the reinvention of animation. It was Disney, first with Mickey Mouse and then with his feature films\u2014most notably Snow White, Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo, and Bambi\u2014who transformed animation from a novelty based on movement to an art form that presented an illusion of life.We see him reimagine the amusement park with Disneyland, prompting critics to coin the word Disneyfication to describe the process by which reality can be modified to fit one\u2019s personal desires. At the same time, he provided a new way to connect with American history through his live-action films and purveyed a view of the country so coherent that even today one can speak meaningfully of \u201cWalt Disney\u2019s America.\u201d We see how the True-Life Adventure nature documentaries he produced helped create the environmental movement by sensitizing the general public to issues of conservation. And we see how he reshaped the entertainment industry by building a synergistic empire that combined film, television, theme parks, music, book publishing, and merchandise in a way that was unprecedented and was later widely imitated.Gabler also reveals a wounded, lonely, and often disappointed man, who, despite worldwide success, was plagued with financial problems much of his life, suffered a nervous breakdown, and at times retreated into pitiable seclusion in his workshop making model trains. Gabler explores accusations that Disney was a red-baiter, an anti-Semite, an embittered alcoholic. But whatever the characterizations of Disney\u2019s personal life, he appealed to the nation by demonstrating the power of wish fulfillment and the triumph of the American imagination. Walt Disney showed how one could impose one\u2019s will on the world.This is a masterly biography, a revelation of both the work and the man\u2014of both the remarkable accomplishment and the hidden life.",

Think about your phone, cameras, cars-everything-being automated and programmed by people who in their rush to accept the many benefits of the silicon chip, have abdicated their responsibility to make these products easy to use. The Inmates Are Running the Asylum argues that the business executives who make the decisions to develop these products are not the ones in control of the technology used to create them. Insightful and entertaining, The Inmates Are Running the Asylum uses the author's experiences in corporate America to illustrate how talented people continuously design bad software-based products and why we need technology to work the way average people think. Somewhere out there is a happy medium that makes these types of products both user and bottom-line friendly; this book discusses why we need to quickly find that medium.",

            "description": "Meadows\u2019 Thinking in Systems, is a concise and crucial book offering insight for problem solving on scales ranging from the personal to the global. Edited by the Sustainability Institute\u2019s Diana Wright, this essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life.Some of the biggest problems facing the world\u2014war, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation\u2014are essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking.While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into the science behind global dilemmas.

An $80,000 Porsche, in our opinion, is far preferable to a $36,000 Volkswagen that is basically the same automobile. We believe that $225 sneakers feel and look better on our feet than a $25 pair. And it's only true if you believe it.Great marketers don't talk about features or even benefits, as Seth Godin has taught hundreds of thousands of marketers and students across the world. Rather, they convey a story\u2014one that we want to believe, whether or not it's true.Every company is a marketer, and all marketing is about telling stories in a world where most people have an endless amount of options and little time to make them.\u200dMarketers thrive when they present us a tale that suits our worldview, one that we intuitively embrace and then tell our friends about. Consider Dyson vacuum cleaners, Fiji water, or iPods.\u200dBut be careful: if your stories are false, you've crossed the line into fraud. Marketers fail when they are self-serving and deceptive, when they abuse their trade's instruments and make the world a worse place. Telemarketers, tobacco corporations, and corrupt politicians have all learned this the hard way.For the rest of us, though, it's time to embrace the story's power. \"Stories make it simpler to grasp the world,\" writes Godin. We realise that the best way to disseminate a concept is via stories. Storytelling was not invented by marketers. They've just nailed it.\"",

            "description": "An argument that operational urban planning can be improved by the application of the tools of urban economics to the design of regulations and infrastructure.Urban planning is a craft learned through practice. Planners make rapid decisions that have an immediate impact on the ground--the width of streets, the minimum size of land parcels, the heights of buildings. The language they use to describe their objectives is qualitative--\"sustainable,\" \"livable,\" \"resilient\"--often with no link to measurable outcomes. Urban economics, on the other hand, is a quantitative science, based on theories, models, and empirical evidence largely developed in academic settings. In this book, the eminent urban planner Alain Bertaud argues that applying the theories of urban economics to the practice of urban planning would greatly improve both the productivity of cities and the welfare of urban citizens.Bertaud explains that markets provide the indispensable mechanism for cities' development. He cites the experience of cities without markets for land or labor in pre-reform China and Russia; this \"urban planners' dream\" created inefficiencies and waste. Drawing on five decades of urban planning experience in forty cities around the world, Bertaud links cities' productivity to the size of their labor markets; argues that the design of infrastructure and markets can complement each other; examines the spatial distribution of land prices and densities; stresses the importance of mobility and affordability; and critiques the land use regulations in a number of cities that aim at redesigning existing cities instead of just trying to alleviate clear negative externalities. Bertaud concludes by describing the new role that joint teams of urban planners and economists could play to improve the way cities are managed.",

            "description": "Recent decades have seen a dramatic shift away from social forms of gambling played around roulette wheels and card tables to solitary gambling at electronic terminals. \"Addiction by Design\" takes readers into the intriguing world of machine gambling, an increasingly popular and absorbing form of play that blurs the line between human and machine, compulsion and control, risk and reward.Drawing on fifteen years of field research in Las Vegas, anthropologist Natasha Dow Schull shows how the mechanical rhythm of electronic gambling pulls players into a trancelike state they call the \"machine zone,\" in which daily worries, social demands, and even bodily awareness fade away. Once in the zone, gambling addicts play not to win but simply to keep playing, for as long as possible--even at the cost of physical and economic exhaustion. In continuous machine play, gamblers seek to lose themselves while the gambling industry seeks profit. Schull describes the strategic calculations behind game algorithms and machine ergonomics, casino architecture and \"ambience management,\" player tracking and cash access systems--all designed to meet the market's desire for maximum \"time on device.\" Her account moves from casino floors into gamblers' everyday lives, from gambling industry conventions and Gamblers Anonymous meetings to regulatory debates over whether addiction to gambling machines stems from the consumer, the product, or the interplay between the two.\"Addiction by Design\" is a compelling inquiry into the intensifying traffic between people and machines of chance, offering clues to some of the broader anxieties and predicaments of contemporary life.",

First published in 1972, it was based on the BBC television series about which the Sunday Times critic commented: \"This is an eye-opener in more ways than one: by concentrating on how we look at paintings . . . he will almost certainly change the way you look at pictures.\" By now he has.\"The influence of the series and the book . . . was enormous . . . It opened up for general attention to areas of cultural study that are now commonplace.\" \u2014Geoff Dyer\"Berger has the ability to cut right through the mystification of the professional art critics . . . He is a liberator of images: and once we have allowed the paintings to work on us directly, we are in a much better position to make a meaningful evaluation.\" \u2014Peter Fuller, Arts Review",

Legendary psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (\u201cThe leading researcher into \u2018flow states.\u2019\u201d \u00a0\u2014 Newsweek) reveals what leads to these moments\u2014be it the excitement of the artist at the easel or the scientist in the lab\u2014so that this knowledge can be used to enrich people's lives. Drawing on nearly one hundred interviews with exceptional people, from biologists and physicists, to politicians and business leaders, to poets and artists, as well as his thirty years of research on the subject, Csikszentmihalyi uses his famous flow theory to explore the creative process. He discusses such ideas as why creative individuals are often seen as selfish and arrogant, and why the \"tortured genius\" is largely a myth. Most important, he explains why creativity needs to be cultivated and is necessary for the future of our country, if not the world.",

Thinking with Type is the definitive guide to using typography in visual communication, from the printed page to the computer screen. This revised edition includes forty-eight pages of new content, including the latest information on style sheets for print and the web, the use of ornaments and captions, lining and non-lining numerals, the use of small caps and enlarged capitals, as well as information on captions, font licensing, mixing typefaces, and hand lettering. Throughout the book, visual examples show how to be inventive within systems of typographic form--what the rules are and how to break them.Thinking with Type is a type book for everyone: designers, writers, editors, students, and anyone else who works with words. The popular companion website to Thinking with Type has been revised to reflect the new material in this second edition.",

            "description": "Too many new companies and products have names that look like the results of a drunken Scrabble(R) game (Xobni, Svbtle, Doostang). In this entertaining and engaging book, ace-naming consultant Alexandra Watkins explains how anyone--even noncreative types--can create memorable and effective brand names. No degree in linguistics required.The heart of the book is Watkins's proven SMILE and SCRATCH Test. A great name makes you SMILE because it is Suggestive--evokes a positive brand experience; is Meaningful--your customers get it; uses Imagery--visually evocative to aid in memory; has Legs--lends itself to a theme for extended mileage; and is Emotional--moves people.A bad name, on the other hand, makes you SCRATCH your head because it is Spelling challenged--looks like a typo; is a Copycat--similar to competitors' names; is Restrictive--limits future growth; is Annoying--frustrates customers; is Tame--flat, uninspired; suffers from the Curse of Knowledge--only insiders get it; and is Hard to pronounce.Watkins also provides up-to-date advice, like making sure that Siri spells your name correctly. And you'll see dozens of examples--the good, the bad, and the \"so bad she gave them an award.\" Alexandra Watkins is not afraid to name names.",

Ideas for new businesses, solutions to the world's problems, and artistic breakthroughs are common, but great execution is rare.According to Scott Belsky, the capacity to make ideas happen can be developed by anyone willing to develop their organizational habits and leadership capability. That's why he founded Behance, a company that helps creative people and teams across industries develop these skills.Belsky has spent six years studying the habits of creative people and teams that are especially productive-the ones who make their ideas happen time and time again. After interviewing hundreds of successful creatives, he has compiled their most powerful-and often counterintuitive-practices, such as:Generate ideas in moderation and kill ideas liberallyPrioritize through naggingEncourage fighting within your teamWhile many of us obsess about discovering great new ideas, Belsky shows why it's better to develop the capacity to make ideas happen-a capacity that endures over time.",

It\u2019s what helped Apple recover from near death in 1997 to become the most valuable company on earth in 2012.As ad agency creative director, Ken Segall played a key role in Apple\u2019s resurrection, helping to create such critical marketing campaigns as \u201cThink Different\u201d and naming the iMac.This book makes you a fly on the wall inside a conference room with Steve Jobs, and on the receiving end of his midnight phone calls. You\u2019ll understand how his obsession with Simplicity helped Apple perform better and faster, sometimes saving millions in the process.Segall brings Apple\u2019s quest for Simplicity to life using fascinating (and previously untold) stories from behind the scenes. Through his insight and wit, you\u2019ll discover how companies that leverage this power can stand out from competitors\u2014and individuals who master it can become critical assets to their organizations.",

Naomi Klein's second book, The Shock Doctrine, was hailed as a \"master narrative of our time,\" and has over a million copies in print worldwide.In the last decade, No Logo has become an international phenomenon and a cultural manifesto for the critics of unfettered capitalism worldwide. As America faces a second economic depression, Klein's analysis of our corporate and branded world is as timely and powerful as ever.Equal parts cultural analysis, political manifesto, mall-rat memoir, and journalistic expos\u00e9, No Logo is the first book to put the new resistance into pop-historical and clear economic perspective. Naomi Klein tells a story of rebellion and self-determination in the face of our new branded world.",

The author suggests that natural vision depends on the eyes in the head on a body supported by the ground, the brain being only the central organ of a complete visual system. When no constraints are put on the visual system, people look around, walk up to something interesting and move around it so as to see it from all sides, and go from one vista to another. That is natural vision -- and what this book is about.",

            "description": "The first monograph, design manual, and manifesto by Michael Bierut, one of the world\u2019s most renowned graphic designers\u2014a career retrospective that showcases more than thirty-five of his most noteworthy projects for clients as the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Yale School of Architecture, the New York Times, Saks Fifth Avenue, and the New York Jets, and reflects eclectic enthusiasm and accessibility that has been the hallmark of his career.Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of design legend Massimo Vignelli and partner in the New York office of the international design firm Pentagram, Michael Bierut has had one of the most varied and successful careers of any living graphic designer, serving a broad spectrum of clients as diverse as Saks Fifth Avenue, Harley-Davidson, the Atlantic Monthly, the William Jefferson Clinton Foundation, Billboard, Princeton University, the New York Jets, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and the Morgan Library.\u200dHow to, Bierut\u2019s first career retrospective, is a landmark work in the field. Featuring more than thirty-five of his projects, it reveals his philosophy of graphic design\u2014how to use it to sell things, explain things, make things look better, make people laugh, make people cry, and (every once in a while) change the world. Specially chosen to illustrate the breadth and reach of graphic design today, each entry demonstrates Bierut\u2019s eclectic approach. In his entertaining voice, the artist walks us through each from start to finish, mixing historic images, preliminary drawings (including full-size reproductions of the notebooks he has maintained for more than thirty-five years), working models and rejected alternatives, as well as the finished work. Throughout, he provides insights into the creative process, his working life, his relationship with clients, and the struggles that any design professional faces in bringing innovative ideas to the world.Offering insight and inspiration for artists, designers, students, and anyone interested in how words, images, and ideas can be put together, How to provides insight to the design process of one of this century\u2019s most renowned creative minds.",

These lenses are gathered from fields as diverse as psychology, architecture, music, visual design, film, software engineering, theme park design, mathematics, writing, puzzle design, and anthropology. Anyone who reads this book will be inspired to become a better game designer\u2014and will understand how to do it.",

Spanning over a century of sweeping changes, from women\u2019s rights to the Great Depression to World War II to the rise of the digital era, this book unpacks the ways in which the world has been\u2015and continues to be\u2015remade according to the principles of the once-obscure discipline of user-experience design.In this essential text, Kuang and Fabricant map the hidden rules of the designed world and shed light on how those rules have caused our world to change\u2015an underappreciated but essential history that\u2019s pieced together for the first time. Combining the expertise and insight of a leading journalist and a pioneering designer, User Friendly provides a definitive, thoughtful, and practical perspective on a topic that has rapidly gone from arcane to urgent to inescapable. In User Friendly, Kuang and Fabricant tell the whole story for the first time\u2015and you\u2019ll never interact with technology the same way again.",

Beautiful Evidence is about how seeing turns into showing, how data and evidence turn into explanation. The book identifies excellent and effective methods for showing nearly every kind of information, suggests many new designs (including sparklines), and provides analytical tools for assessing the credibility of evidence presentations (which are seen from both sides: how to produce and how to consume presentations). For alert consumers of presentations, there are chapters on diagnosing evidence corruption and PowerPoint pitches.\u200dBeautiful Evidence concludes with two chapters that leave the world of pixel and paper flatland representations - and move onto seeing and thinking in space land, the real-land of three-space and time.",

This unique guide to interactive system design reflects the experience and vision of Jef Raskin, the creator of the Apple Macintosh. Other books may show how to use todays widgets and interface ideas effectively. Raskin, however, demonstrates that many current interface paradigms are dead ends, and that to make computers significantly easier to use requires new approaches. He explains how to effect desperately needed changes, offering a wealth of innovative and specific interface ideas for software designers, developers, and product managers.",

            "description": "Here's something you may not know about today's Internet. Simply by designing your product the right way, you can build a flourishing business from scratch. No advertising or marketing budget, no need for a sales force, and venture capitalists will flock to throw money at you.Many of the most successful Web 2.0 companies, including MySpace, YouTube, eBay, and rising stars like Twitter and Flickr, are prime examples of what journalist Adam L. Penenberg calls a \"viral loop\"--to use it, you have to spread it. After all, what's the sense of being on Facebook if none of your friends are The result: Never before has there been the potential to create wealth this fast, on this scale, and starting with so little.In this game-changing must-read, Penenberg tells the fascinating story of the entrepreneurs who first harnessed the unprecedented potential of viral loops to create the successful online businesses--some worth billions of dollars--that we have all grown to rely on. The trick is that they created something people really want, so much so that their customers happily spread the word about their product for them.All kinds of businesses--from the smallest start-ups to nonprofit organizations to the biggest multinational corporations--can use the paradigm-busting power of viral loops to enable their business through technology. Viral Loop is a must-read for any entrepreneur or business interested in uncorking viral loops to benefit their bottom line.",

            "description": "More forcefully than any other method of communication, a good visualization can express the nature and potential significance of information and ideas.For a long time, \"dataviz\" was the domain of experts\u2014data scientists and designers. That is no longer the case. A new generation of tools and vast amounts of data make it simple for anybody to build visualizations that express concepts significantly more effectively than traditional spreadsheet charts.Furthermore, creating effective charts is increasingly becoming a necessary talent for managers. Other managers are doing it if you aren't, and they're receiving acknowledged and credit for contributing to your company's success.Dataviz maven, in Good Charts Scott Berinato presents a comprehensive overview of visualization and how to utilize it to impress and persuade others. Dataviz is today's equivalent of spreadsheets and word processors in the early 1980s, when they were on the verge of revolutionizing the way we operate. Through a process of discussing, drawing, and experimenting, Berinato sets out a technique for thinking visually and generating better charts.This book is much more than a set of prescriptive guidelines for creating visuals. It explores why excellent charts (and terrible charts) elicit \"feelings behind our eyes\" by drawing on both well-established and cutting-edge studies in visual perception and neurology, as well as the new subject of visualization science. Along the way, Berinato also includes many engaging vignettes of dataviz pros, illustrating the ideas in practice.Good Charts will help you turn plain, uninspiring charts that merely present information into smart, effective visualizations that powerfully convey ideas.",

But as the field evolves, designers enter the field from many disciplines. Practitioners today have enough experience in UI design that they have been exposed to design rules, but it is essential that they understand the psychology behind the rules in order to effectively apply them. In \"Designing with the Mind in Mind,\" Jeff Johnson, author of the best selling \"GUI Bloopers,\" provides designers with just enough background in perceptual and cognitive psychology that UI design guidelines make intuitive sense rather than being just a list of rules to follow.The first practical, all-in-one source for practitioners on user interface design rules and why, when and how to apply them.Provides just enough background into the reasoning behind interface design rules that practitioners can make informed decisions in every project.Gives practitioners the insight they need to make educated design decisions when confronted with tradeoffs, including competing design rules, time constrictions, or limited resources.",

            "description": "An Essay on Typography was first published in 1931, instantly recognized as a classic, and has long been unavailable. It represents Gill at his best opinionated, fustian, and consistently humane. It is his only major work on typography and remains indispensable for anyone interested in the art of letter forms and the presentation of graphic information.This manifesto, however, is not only about letters their form, fit, and function but also about man's role in an industrial society. As Gill wrote later, it was his chief object \"to describe two worlds that of industrialism and that of the human workman & to define their limits.\"His thinking about type is still provocative. Here are the seeds of modern advertising unjustified lines, tight word and letter spacing, ample leading. Here, too, is vintage Gill, as polemical as he is practical, as much concerned about the soul of man as the work of man; as much obsessed by the ends as by the means.",

            "description": "The first book to capture the philosophy and spirit behind the work of Charles and Ray Eames, \"An Eames Primer\" offers an in-depth look at the couple's prolific legacy--one that has placed them among the most important American designers of the twentieth century. Those who know one or two aspects of the Eameses' work are often surprised to learn just how far and vast their range extended. Yet throughout their myriad works, from architecture and furniture to exhibition and design and filmmaking, their core philosphy prevails. \"An Eames Primer\" is the first book to illuminate this seamless connection.Author Eames Demetrios explores the rich energy of the Eameses' world from a unique perspective, informed by his close relationship with Charles and Ray. He shares personal anecdotes, previously unpublished photos, and his extensive interviews with former friends and colleagues of the Eameses to make connections between the Eameses' influential philosophy and their widely admired work. For those unacquainted with the designers, the stories behind the design process will inform, entertain, and inspire, while readers with an extensive knowledge of the Eameses' work gain a deeper level of understanding their process.Compact and highly accessible, \"An Eames Primer\" is the definitive introduction to the life of this century's most influential designers.",

If a text has anything at all significant to say, it needs a typographer\u2019s care, which will in turn be repaid by the reader\u2019s attention. If you design websites or use CSS then you are a typographer whether you know it or not.This book is a practical guide and companion reference to all aspects of typography on the web. It deftly combines implement\u00adation details with typographic theory, and is ideal for designers, developers and anyone else involved in the process of creating a website.",

            "description": "Nudge meets Hooked in a practical approach to designing products and services that change behavior, from what we buy to how we work.Deciding what to create at modern companies often looks like an episode of Mad Men: people throw ideas around until one sounds sexy enough to execute and then they scale it to everyone. The result? Companies overspend on marketing to drive engagement with products and services that people don't want and won't help them be happier and healthier.\u200dStart at the End offers a new framework for design, grounded in behavioral science. Technology executive and behavioral scientist Matt Wallaert argues that the purpose of everything is behavior change. By starting with outcomes instead of processes, the most effective companies understand what people want to do and why they aren't already doing it, then build products and services to bridge the gap.Wallaert is a behavioral psychologist who has led product design at organizations ranging from startups like Clover Health to industry leaders such as Microsoft. Whether dissecting the success behind Uber's ridesharing service or Flamin' Hot Cheetos, he underscores with clarity and humor how this approach can improve the way we work and live.This is an essential roadmap for building products that matter--and changing behavior for the better.",

            "description": "Keep Working. Keep Playing. Keep Creating.In his previous books Steal Like an Artist and Show Your Work!, both New York Times bestsellers, Austin Kleon gave readers the keys to unlock their creativity and showed them how to become known. Now he offers his most inspiring work yet, with ten simple rules for how to stay creative, focused, and true to yourself\u2014for life.The creative life is not a linear journey to a finish line, it\u2019s a loop\u2014so find a daily routine, because today is the only day that matters. Disconnect from the world to connect with yourself\u2014sometimes you just have to switch into airplane mode. Keep Going celebrates getting outdoors and taking a walk (as director Ingmar Bergman told his daughter, \u201dThe demons hate fresh air\u201d). Pay attention, and especially pay attention to what you pay attention to. Worry less about getting things done, and more about the worth of what you\u2019re doing. Instead of focusing on making your mark, work to leave things better than you found them.\u200dKeep Going and its timeless, practical, and ethical principles are for anyone trying to sustain a meaningful and productive life.",

It is important that these implementations are the same throughout the Web, otherwise it becomes a messy proprietary place, and lacks consistency. These standards also allow content to be more compatible with multiple different viewing devices, such as screen readers for people with vision impairments, cell phones, PDFs, etc. HTML, XML, and CSS are all such technologies.This book is your essential guide to understanding the advantages you can bring to your web pages by implementing web standards and precisely how to apply them.",

While the emphasis is on design, the method is comprehensive. As a result, designers, usability experts, the HCI community, product managers, and business executives will benefit from the book. An focus is placed on combining the back-end concerns of usability and engineering excellence (getting the design right) with an upfront investment in drawing and brainstorming (getting the right design). Overall, the goal is to develop the concept of informed design, which entails shaping emergent technology into a shape that supports and reflects our society's ideals.Bill Buxton's entertaining work, which is based on both practise and scientific study, attempts to stimulate the imagination while promoting the application of new methodologies, infusing new life into user experience design.",

            "description": "The definitive playbook by the pioneers of Growth Hacking, one of the hottest business methodologies in Silicon Valley and beyond.It seems hard to believe today, but there was a time when Airbnb was the best-kept secret of travel hackers and couch surfers, Pinterest was a niche web site frequented only by bakers and crafters, LinkedIn was an exclusive network for C-suite executives and top-level recruiters, Facebook was MySpace's sorry step-brother, and Uber was a scrappy upstart that didn't stand a chance against the Goliath that was New York City Yellow Cabs.So how did these companies grow from these humble beginnings into the powerhouses they are today? Contrary to popular belief, they didn't explode to massive worldwide popularity simply by building a great product then crossing their fingers and hoping it would catch on. There was a studied, carefully implemented methodology behind these companies' extraordinary rise. That methodology is called Growth Hacking, and it's practitioners include not just today's hottest start-ups, but also companies like IBM, Walmart, and Microsoft as well as the millions of entrepreneurs, marketers, managers and executives who make up the community of GrowthHackers.com.Think of the Growth Hacking methodology as doing for market-share growth what Lean Start-Up did for product development, and Scrum did for productivity. It involves cross-functional teams and rapid-tempo testing and iteration that focuses customers attaining them, retaining them, engaging them, and motivating them to come back and buy more.An accessible and practical toolkit that teams and companies in all industries can use to increase their customer base and market share, this book walks readers through the process of creating and executing their own custom-made growth hacking strategy. It is a must read for any marketer, entrepreneur, innovator or manger looking to replace wasteful big bets and \"spaghetti-on-the-wall\" approaches with more consistent, replicable, cost-effective, and data-driven results.",

We no longer simply choose typefaces, font sizes, line spacing, and margins; we prepare and instruct text to make those choices for itself. In this book, Tim Brown illuminates the complex, beautiful world of typesetting-arguably the most important part of typography because it forms the backbone of the reading experience-and shows us how to parry the inevitable pressures that arise when we can no longer predict how, and where, our text will be read.",

More than a guide to visual appreciation, this is a book about how to recognize, evaluate, and understand the objects and landscape of the man-made world. The pursuit of design is not about the way things appear, but rather about the way things give meaning and relevance to the human experience.",

            "description": "In 1951, designer Greta Magnusson Grossman observed that California design was \"not a superimposed style, but an answer to present conditions.... It has developed out of our own preferences for living in a modern way.\" California design influenced the material culture of the entire country, in everything from architecture to fashion. This generously illustrated book, which accompanies a major exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, is the first comprehensive examination of California's mid-century modern design. It begins by tracing the origins of a distinctively California modernism in the 1930s by such European \u00e9migr\u00e9s as Richard Neutra, Rudolph Schindler, and Kem Weber; it finds other specific design influences and innovations in solid-color commercial ceramics, inspirations from Mexico and Asia, new schools for design training, new concepts about leisure, and the conversion of wartime technologies to peacetime use (exemplified by Charles and Ray Eames's plywood and fiberglass furniture).The heart of California Design is the modern California home, famously characterized by open plans conducive to outdoor living. The layouts of modernist homes by Pierre Koenig, Craig Ellwood, and Raphael Soriano, for example, were intended to blur the distinction between indoors and out. Homes were furnished with products from Heath Ceramics, Van Keppel-Green, and Architectural Pottery as well as other, previously unheralded companies and designers. Many objects were designed to be multifunctional: pool and patio furniture that was equally suitable indoors, lighting that was both task and ambient, bookshelves that served as room dividers, and bathing suits that would turn into ensembles appropriate for indoor entertainment. California Design includes 350 images, most in color, of furniture, ceramics, metalwork, architecture, graphic and industrial design, film, textiles, and fashion, and ten incisive essays that trace the rise of the California design aesthetic.",

Anyone who works with type should find this facsimile of Tschichold's work of interest. Jan Tschichold was the recipient of prizes that included the AIGA Gold Medal in 1954 and the Leipzig Gutenberg Prize in 1965.",

            "description": "A grid system is a rigid framework that is supposed to help graphic designers in the meaningful, logical and consistent organization of information on a page. It is an established tool that is used by print and web designers to create well-structured, balanced designs. Rudimentary versions of grid systems existed since the medieval times, but a group of Swiss graphic designers, mostly inspired in ideas from typographical literature started building a more rigid and coherent system for page layout. The core of these ideas were first presented by M\u00fcller-Brockmann who helped to spread the knowledge about the grids thorough the world. This volume provides guidelines and rules for the function and use for grid systems from 8 to 32 grid fields which can be used for the most varied of projects, the three-dimensional grid being treated as well. Exact directions for using all of the grid systems possibe presented are given to the user, showing examples of working correctly on a conceptual level.",

The twelve proclamations were written to inspire owners of independent creative businesses (e.g.: design firms & advertising agencies) to rethink how their services are bought and sold. Anyone who sells ideas or advice will find relevance in their teachings.",

In his words, so pervasive are they in their personal, political, economic, aesthetic, psychological, moral, ethical and social consequences that they leave no part of us untouched, unaffected, or unaltered.McLuhan suggests modern audiences enjoy MainStream media as soothing, enjoyable, and relaxing; however, the pleasure we find in the MainStream media is deceiving, because/as/since the changes between society and technology are incongruent, perpetuating an Age of Anxiety.McLuhan's remarkable observation that \"societies have always been shaped more by the nature of the media by which men communicate than by the content of the communication\" is undoubtedly more relevant today than ever before. With the rise of the internet and the explosion of the digital revolution there has never been a better time to revisit Marshall McLuhan.",

This comprehensive guide is intended to advance the progress of designers seeking to deepen their typographic expertise. Typography Essentials is a practical, hands-on resource to distill, organize, and compartmentalize\u2014but not to oversimplify\u2014the many complex issues surrounding the effective use of typography. It is for designers of every medium in which type plays a major role, and is organized and designed to make the process enjoyable and entertaining, as well as instructional.This book is divided into four easy-to-use sections: The Letter, The Word, The Paragraph, and The Page. Each of the 100 principles has an explanation and examples representing the principle in action.",

            "description": "A book about User Experience Design should be like the approach it advocates: User Friendly with functional visuals that makes for an easy \"navigation\", and a pleasure to hold, turn the page, leave on the shelf, or carry in your backpack. This book is heavily packed with small bites of information every UX Designer should know.The book visually presents the most important definitions, methods and techniques for an easy to follow and immersive experience. My hope is that it will become the go-to dictionary for every designer, thanks to its well organized format.UX BITES starts by defining the meaning and value of User Experience Design and presents the most efficient workflows of the UX process. It then makes a case for adopting a user-centric approach, while helping the reader master ways to understand their user. Presenting frequently used research methods, and explaining how to apply each, it prepares the reader to take real UX projects head on. The final two chapters move the spotlight to practical tips and statistics every designer can apply, and as a conclusion, it ends highlighting unethical practices to avoid as a UX Designer.",

Because no one can be an expert on everything, designers have always had to scramble to find the information and know-how required to make a design work - until now.\u200dUniversal Principles of Design is the first cross-disciplinary reference of design. Richly illustrated and easy to navigate, this book pairs clear explanations of the design concepts featured with visual examples of those concepts applied in practice. From the 80/20 rule to chunking, from baby-face bias to Ockham's razor, and from self-similarity to storytelling, 100 design concepts are defined and illustrated for readers to expand their knowledge.This landmark reference will become the standard for designers, engineers, architects, and students who seek to broaden and improve their design expertise.",

After you pop the champagne, accept the shiny new title, and step into this thrilling next chapter of your career, the truth descends like a fog: you don't really know what you're doing.That's exactly how Julie Zhuo felt when she became a rookie manager at the age of 25. She stared at a long list of logistics--from hiring to firing, from meeting to messaging, from planning to pitching--and faced a thousand questions and uncertainties. How was she supposed to spin teamwork into value? How could she be a good steward of her reports' careers? What was the secret to leading with confidence in new and unexpected situations?Now, having managed dozens of teams spanning tens to hundreds of people, Julie knows the most important lesson of all: great managers are made, not born. If you care enough to be reading this, then you care enough to be a great manager.\u200dThe Making of a Manager is a modern field guide packed everyday examples and transformative insights, including:How to tell a great manager from an average manager (illustrations included)When you should look past an awkward interview and hire someone anywayHow to build trust with your reports through not being a bossWhere to look when you lose faith and lack the answersWhether you're new to the job, a veteran leader, or looking to be promoted, this is the handbook you need to be the kind of manager you wish you had.",

            "description": "Discover the techniques behind beautiful design by deconstructing designs to understand them. The term 'hacker' has been redefined to consist of anyone who has an insatiable curiosity as to how things work--and how they can try to make them better. This book is aimed at hackers of all skill levels and explains the classical principles and techniques behind beautiful designs by deconstructing those designs in order to understand what makes them so remarkable. Author and designer David Kadavy provides you with the framework for understanding good design and places a special emphasis on interactive mediums. You'll explore color theory, the role of proportion and geometry in design, and the relationship between medium and form.Packed with unique reverse engineering design examples, this book inspires and encourages you to discover and create new beauty in a variety of formats. Breaks down and studies the classical principles and techniques behind the creation of beautiful design. Illustrates cultural and contextual considerations in communicating to a specific audience. Discusses why design is important, the purpose of design, the various constraints of design, and how today's fonts are designed with the screen in mind. Dissects the elements of color, size, scale, proportion, medium, and form. Features a unique range of examples, including the graffiti in the ancient city of Pompeii, the lack of the color black in Monet's art, the style and sleekness of the iPhone, and more.By the end of this book, you'll be able to apply the featured design principles to your own web designs, mobile apps, or other digital work.",

In this surprisingly funny, but incredibly practical advice guide, Janda's advice on teamwork and collaboration, relationship building, managing clients, bidding work, production processes, and more will resonate with creative professionals of all stripes.",

Whether you\u2019re enraged by Ikea\u2019s Verdanagate, want to know what the Beach Boys have in common with easy Jet or why it\u2019s okay to like Comic Sans, Just My Type will have the answer. Learn why using upper case got a New Zealand health worker sacked. Refer to Prince in the Tafkap years as a Dingbat (that works on many levels). Spot where movies get their time periods wrong and don\u2019t be duped by fake posters on eBay. Simon Garfield meets the people behind the typefaces and along the way learns why some fonts \u2013 like men \u2013 are from Mars and some are from Venus. From type on the high street and album covers, to the print in our homes and offices, Garfield is the font of all types of knowledge.",

            "description": "An impassioned look at games and game design that offers the most ambitious framework for understanding them to date.As pop culture, games are as important as film or television--but game design has yet to develop a theoretical framework or critical vocabulary. In Rules of Play Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman present a much-needed primer for this emerging field. They offer a unified model for looking at all kinds of games, from board games and sports to computer and video games. As active participants in game culture, the authors have written Rules of Play as a catalyst for innovation, filled with new concepts, strategies, and methodologies for creating and understanding games. Building an aesthetics of interactive systems, Salen and Zimmerman define core concepts like play, design, and interactivity. They look at games through a series of eighteen game design schemas, or conceptual frameworks, including games as systems of emergence and information, as contexts for social play, as a storytelling medium, and as sites of cultural resistance.Written for game scholars, game developers, and interactive designers, Rules of Play is a textbook, reference book, and theoretical guide. It is the first comprehensive attempt to establish a solid theoretical framework for the emerging discipline of game design.",

            "description": "\"When everybody zigs, zag,\" says Marty Neumeier in this fresh view of brand strategy. ZAG follows the ultra-clear \"whiteboard overview\" style of the author's first book, THE BRAND GAP, but drills deeper into the question of how brands can harness the power of differentiation. The author argues that in an extremely cluttered marketplace, traditional differentiation is no longer enough--today companies need \"radical differentiation\" to create lasting value for their shareholders and customers. In an entertaining 3-hour read you'll learn:why me-too brands are doomed to failhow to \"read\" customer feedback on new products and messagesthe 17 steps for designing \"difference\" into your brandhow to turn your brand's \"onliness\" into a \"trueline\" to drive synergythe secrets of naming products, services, and companiesthe four deadly dangers faced by brand portfolioshow to \"stretch\" your brand without breaking ithow to succeed at all three stages of the competition cycleIn an age of me-too products and instant communications, keeping up with the competition is no longer a winning strategy. Today you have to out-position, out-maneuver, and out-design the competition. The new rule? When everybody zigs, zag. In his first book, THE BRAND GAP, Neumeier showed companies how to bridge the distance between business strategy and design. In ZAG, he illustrates the number-one strategy of high-performance brands--radical differentiation.",

You need to grab the attention of potential customers, clients, or supporters and call them to action. Few among us are born talented copywriters, that rare combination of both facile wordsmiths and natural salespeople. Most of us need some help, and even naturals can improve by studying the best. Victor O. Schwab was one of the greats. Considered a marketing master during his 44-year career, he was the copywriter who propelled Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People into a mega-seller.How to Write a Good Advertisement gets you quickly up to speed with examples of powerful profitable headlines (with explanations of why those headlines work so well), and quick lesson reviews that help you turn what you've read into skills you own. Schwab provides us shortcuts without sacrificing long-term understanding. Fifty years after publication this book is still the standard bearer, sought after by a new generation of copy-writers and businesspeople. Read it, apply it, and watch your sales soar.",

            "description": "This book offers a novel overview of typeface design, exploring the most beautiful and remarkable examples of font catalogs from the history of publishing, with a special emphasis on the period from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century, when color catalogs were at their height. Taken from a Dutch collection, this exuberant selection traverses the evolution of the printed letter in all its various incarnations via exquisitely designed catalogs displaying not only type specimens in roman, italic, bold, semi-bold, narrow, and broad, but also characters, borders, ornaments, initial letters and decorations as well as often spectacular examples of the use of the letters. The Victorian fonts, sumptuous and sometimes unbelievably outrageous, are accorded a prominent place in this book. In addition to lead letters, examples from lithography and letters by window-dressers, inscription carvers, and calligraphers are also displayed and described.Featuring works by type designers including: William Caslon, Fritz Helmuth Ehmcke, Peter Behrens, Rudolf Koch, Eric Gill, Jan van Krimpen, Paul Renner, Jan Tschichold, A. M. Cassandre, Aldo Novarese, Adrian Frutiger.In order to include a vast amount of material, we have divided this text into two volumes. The first volume displays pre 20th Century type specimens, and the second covers the period from 1900 to the middle of the century. In the first volume, editor Cees de Jong and collector Jan Tholenaar write about single specimens and types; in the second, Alston Purvis outlines the history of types.",

            "description": "The first two volumes chronicling the unique art and design of Roger Dean met with huge critical and popular success. Views (1975) went straight to number one in the Sunday Times bestseller list and went on to sell over a million copies. Magnetic Storm (1984) sold over 650,000 copies. These new editions, reworked to accompany the publication of the third book in the trilogy, Dragon's Dream, showcase the instantly recognizable work of Roger Dean.Views showcases the first seven years of Roger Dean's work after his graduation from the Royal College of Art in 1968. It includes paintings and graphics; branding such as the Yes typography and the first Virgin Records logo; groundbreaking stage sets; and album art including iconic early Yes covers such as the award-winning Tales From Topographic Oceans. The new edition streamlines the original square format and retains the combination of concept sketches and brilliantly displayed finished work. Featuring a new foreword, revised typography, and graphic openers and identifying icons, Views showcases and celebrates the art that defined an era.",

Like virtually all heavy-hitting thinkers, they looked beyond just words and numbers to get intellectual and creative insights. They actively applied a deceptively simple tool to think both smarter and faster: the doodle. And so can the rest of us-zero artistic talent required.Visual thinking expert Sunni Brown has created The Doodle Revolution as a kick-starter guide for igniting and applying simple visual language to any challenge. The instinctive and universal act of doodling need only be unleashed in order to innovate, solve problems, and elevate cognitive performance instantly.",

New research on emotion and cognition has shown that attractive things really do work better, as Donald Norman amply demonstrates in this fascinating book, which has garnered acclaim everywhere from Scientific American to The New Yorker.Emotional Design articulates the profound influence of the feelings that objects evoke, from our willingness to spend thousands of dollars on Gucci bags and Rolex watches, to the impact of emotion on the everyday objects of tomorrow.Norman draws on a wealth of examples and the latest scientific insights to present a bold exploration of the objects in our everyday world. Emotional Design will appeal not only to designers and manufacturers but also to managers, psychologists, and general readers who love to think about their stuff.",

After reading this book, you'll have a thorough grasp of what product design entails, as well as the best practices for creating your own successful online goods.",

Freed from the rigorous constraints of designing for real users, sci-fi production designers develop blue-sky interfaces that are inspiring, humorous, and even instructive. By carefully studying these \"outsider\" user interfaces, designers can derive lessons that make their real-world designs more cutting edge and successful.",

But with a typical price tag of $5,000 to $10,000 for a usability consultant to conduct each round of tests, it rarely happens.In this how-to companion to Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, Steve Krug spells out an approach to usability testing that anyone can easily apply to their own web site, application, or other product. (As he said in Don't Make Me Think, \"It's not rocket surgery\".)In this new book, Steve explains how to:Test any design, from a sketch on a napkin to a fully-functioning web site or applicationKeep your focus on finding the most important problems (because no one has the time or resources to fix them all)Fix the problems that you find, using his \"The least you can do\" approachBy pairing the process of testing and fixing products down to its essentials (A morning a month, that's all we ask ), Rocket Surgery makes it realistic for teams to test early and often, catching problems while it's still easy to fix them. Rocket Surgery Made Easy adds demonstration videos to the proven mix of clear writing, before-and-after examples, witty illustrations, and practical advice that made Don't Make Me Think so popular.",

Online identity management, disinhibition, communication via text and photographs, intimacy and misunderstandings in online relationships, conflicting attitudes toward social media, addiction, deviant behavior, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and media overload are among the topics covered by John R. Suler, a founder of the field of cyberpsychology. He introduces the 'Eight Dimensions of Cyberpsychology Architecture,' a novel framework that academics, students, and general readers interested in cyberpsychology may use to create and comprehend various digital landscapes. The person is the emphasis of Psychology of the Digital Age, which sheds fresh insight on our conscious and subconscious reactions to online encounters, as well as our inherent human need to self-actualize.",

Guns, which lead to so much death, work exactly as they\u2019re designed to work. And every time we \u201cimprove\u201d their design, they get better at killing. Facebook\u2019s privacy settings, which have outed gay teens to their conservative parents, are working exactly as designed. Their \u201creal names\u201d initiative, which makes it easier for stalkers to re-find their victims, is working exactly as designed. Twitter\u2019s toxicity and lack of civil discourse is working exactly as it\u2019s designed to work.The world is working exactly as designed. And it\u2019s not working very well. Which means we need to do a better job of designing it. Design is a craft with an amazing amount of power. The power to choose. The power to influence. As designers, we need to see ourselves as gatekeepers of what we are bringing into the world, and what we choose not to bring into the world. Design is a craft with responsibility. The responsibility to help create a better world for all.Design is also a craft with a lot of blood on its hands. Every cigarette ad is on us. Every gun is on us. Every ballot that a voter cannot understand is on us. Every time social network\u2019s interface allows a stalker to find their victim, that\u2019s on us. The monsters we unleash into the world will carry your name.This book will make you see that design is a political act. What we choose to design is a political act. Who we choose to work for is a political act. Who we choose to work with is a political act. And, most importantly, the people we\u2019ve excluded from these decisions is the biggest (and stupidest) political act we\u2019ve made as a society.If you\u2019re a designer, this book might make you angry. It should make you angry. But it will also give you the tools you need to make better decisions. You will learn how to evaluate the potential benefits and harm of what you\u2019re working on. You\u2019ll learn how to present your concerns. You\u2019ll learn the importance of building and working with diverse teams who can approach problems from multiple points-of-view. You\u2019ll learn how to make a case using data and good storytelling. You\u2019ll learn to say NO in a way that\u2019ll make people listen. But mostly, this book will fill you with the confidence to do the job the way you always wanted to be able to do it. This book will help you understand your responsibilities.",

Twenty Bits I Learned About Design, Business & Community is fun little hardcover book that collects those thoughts along with some arguably-artistic doodles.I like to think about this book as a \"mini-memoir with mid-century aesthetics\". Bring a copy on your next flight and gain some insights from a designer-turned-accidental-entrepreneur and the important lessons learned along the way. Easily digestible takeaways for designers, community builders, and creative business leaders.\"",

Writing at the height of his career, Rand articulated in his slender volume the pioneering vision that all design should seamlessly integrate form and function. This facsimile edition preserves Rand's original 1947 essay with the adjustments he made to its text and imagery for a revised printing in 1970, and adds only an informative and inspiring new foreword by design luminary Michael Bierut. As relevant today as it was when first published, this classic treatise is an indispensable addition to the library of every designer.",

            "description": "Interior design guru Axel Vervoordt shares his latest inspirations for the home. Axel Vervoordt\u2019s intense curiosity has fueled his work as an interior designer, spurring him to explore and draw inspiration from cultures around the globe. He was first exposed to Eastern art and philosophy years ago, but today it has become the guiding principle in his work, particularly the concept of Wabi. Developed in the twelfth century, Wabi advocates simplicity and humility, the rejection of all that is superfluous or artificial. Through extraordinary photographs from Japan and Korea to Belgium and Switzerland, Vervoordt invites us to explore the elements that inspire him: natural materials and time-worn objects that evoke the essence of Wabi. Today, together with the Japanese architect Tatsuro Miki, Vervoordt carries the principles of Wabi into his remarkable interiors. As Vervoordt reveals how he infuses his current creations with a fundamentally oriental approach, interiors devotees will gain new insight from this tribute to the designer\u2019s latest sources of inspiration for the home.",

            "description": "In his new book Matthias Schrader, co-founder and CEO of SinnerSchrader, turns the digital transformation from head to toe. Whoever starts the digital transformation at the company has already lost. In the meantime, digital products from companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon are conquering the everyday life of users. They successfully penetrate sectors such as banking, insurance, telecommunications, retail and automotive. Many companies are in danger of losing their relationship with their customers. They become interchangeable. Matthias Schrader deciphers the code behind the Transformational Products, with which Google & Co. successfully reshape entire markets.The book also provides a playbook for the successful development of Transformational Products in the corporate context. In the end, it bridges the gap between product development and the digital transformation of companies. Transformational Products turn classic marketing into a legacy and thus from a solution to a problem. The weapons of advertising (promotion), distribution (place) and pricing policy (price) have become blunt. Digitisation is a huge challenge for the product, the fourth P in the marketing mix. The focus on the product as a success factor forces companies to focus on the concrete value-added contribution for their customers.",

            "description": "Creativity is a uniquely human ability highly prized and sought after, defining the excellence of individuals, corporations, and nations. In the modern era of global competition, the nurturing of creativity in oneself and others has become a major concern for the general public. Until recently, however, human creativity had been treated as a mysterious process of brain activity, since we had neither tools to measure precisely the brain activities nor the theories to analyze and synthesize creativity.The quick advancement of brain science these days thanks largely to the development of various measurement tools such as EEG, EMG, and fMRI and to new attitudes which view the brain as a system has enabled us to discuss creativity in the context of science. Written in an entertaining manner, the book is a modern primer on the science of creativity and would attract a wide audience from those already versed in cognitive or brain sciences to the layman from the street.",

            "description": "For designers working in every medium, layout is arguably the most basic, and most important, element. Effective layout is essential to communication and enables the end user not only to be drawn in with an innovative design but to digest information easily. Making and Breaking the Grid is a comprehensive layout design workshop that assumes that in order to effectively break the rules of grid-based design, one must first understand those rules and see them applied in real-world projects.Text reveals top designers' work in process and rationale. Projects with similar characteristics are linked through a simple notational system that encourages exploration and comparison of structure ideas. Also included are historical overviews that summarize the development of layout concepts, both grid-based and non-grid based, in modern design practice.",

The thoroughly revised edition of the 1965 design ma-nual classic is still setting standards. Especially in times of the re-turn to clear and minimalistic geomet-ric forms and patterns, his rich body of work serves as a perfect starting point for contemporary design practices. Elements of image and form are ana-lyzed and examined with regard to their inherent laws. To correspond to the contemporary design techniques, this new edition is divided into computer-system-friendly sections. Thus adapting Hofmann\u2019s methods to the requirement of modern design practices and serv-ing as a valuable handbook for a new generation of designers.",

As the successor to Emil Ruder at the world-famous Schule fur Gestultung in Basel, he enhanced the rigor of Swiss Typography with experimental verve and creativity; he also put his innovative ideas to work for Typografische Monatsblutter. Countless designers in North America and Europe have been inspired by his teachings and lectures. In Typography, Weingart sums up an impressive lifework in 500 pages that describe his own development and the foundations of his teachings. This is a long-awaited book of epochal significance.",

            "description": "At once a style guide, an inspirational tome, and a how-to volume on creating one's home, this book will serve as a go-to reference for all those seeking to spur their own creativity as they embark on the creation of home. When Diane Keaton decided that she wanted to build her own home from the ground up, she took the advice of her dear friend, film director Nancy Meyers, and took to the boards of Pinterest to find inspiration. There she discovered the practical and the fantastical, elements and styles long adored and ones that she never knew she was drawn to. Keaton's dream house was officially under way and this book that resulted is a compelling account of her that house, from idea to realization in brick, stone, and wood.\u200dThe House that Pinterest Built defines what home and house mean to the celebrated movie star, who is known for her love affair with houses and design. Filled with ideas that reveal a personal yet engaging aesthetic, this volume includes compelling photos from Keaton's past homes and those she admires, as well as a multitude of details from every corner of those spaces and objects that excite and inspire the house designer and dreamer--dramatic staircases and magical light fixtures, film stills and book covers, pottery and art--drawn from the visual treasure trove known as Pinterest and Keaton's private collection, as she creates and designs her newest house.Rich imagery is accompanied by Keaton's ideas for selecting furniture, kitchen layout, and bedroom design; she talks about the importance of lighting in the bathroom and why the living room needs to be reimagined. Beyond the interior, she explores curb appeal and environmental sensitivity, always with an eye to making home the way it should be--a place of tranquility, a place where one is restored and where one returns to dream again and again. The book culminates in the dream realized, the house she has imagined, designed, and made, now shared with the world for the first time in all-new photography.",

Generously illustrated with over three hundred examples\u2014more than two hundred of which are in color\u2014the book charts significant topics including the arrival of mass-production; the birth of the art director; the appearance of the grid (and its subsequent rejection); the coming of non-print media; and the launch of the Macintosh computer and its ushering in of a new generation of designers enfranchised by digital technology.This revised edition of a fundamental work brings the story up to date with new text and images covering type on screen and, in particular, type for the internet. Combining an assessment of the culture of experimentation in contemporary typographic design alongside a clear presentation of the field\u2019s historical context, the book is an informed and accessible source for all students of design and for designers needing an expert overview of typography.",

            "description": "Most programmers' fear of user interface (UI) programming comes from their fear of doing UI design. They think that UI design is like graphic design--the mysterious process by which creative, latte-drinking, all-black-wearing people produce cool-looking, artistic pieces. Most programmers see themselves as analytic, logical thinkers instead--strong at reasoning, weak on artistic judgment, and incapable of doing UI design.In this brilliantly readable book, author Joel Spolsky proposes simple, logical rules that can be applied without any artistic talent to improve any user interface, from traditional GUI applications to websites to consumer electronics. Spolsky's primary axiom, the importance of bringing the program model in line with the user model, is both rational and simple.In a fun and entertaining way, Spolky make user interface design easy for programmers to grasp. After reading User Interface Design for Programmers, you'll know how to design interfaces with the user in mind. You'll learn the important principles that underlie all good UI design, and you'll learn how to perform usability testing that works.",

            "description": "For more than a decade, Clear and Simple as the Truth has guided readers to consider style not as an elegant accessory of effective prose but as its very heart. Francis-No\u00ebl Thomas and Mark Turner present writing as an intellectual activity, not a passive application of verbal skills. In classic style, the motive is truth, the purpose is presentation, the reader and writer are intellectual equals, and the occasion is informal. This general style of presentation is at home everywhere, from business memos to personal letters and from magazine articles to student essays. Everyone talks about style, but no one explains it. The authors of this book do; and in doing so, they provoke the reader to consider style, not as an elegant accessory of effective prose, but as its very heart.At a time when writing skills have virtually disappeared, what can be done? If only people learned the principles of verbal correctness, the essential rules, wouldn't good prose simply fall into place? Thomas and Turner say no. Attending to rules of grammar, sense, and sentence structure will no more lead to effective prose than knowing the mechanics of a golf swing will lead to a hole-in-one. Furthermore, ten-step programs to better writing exacerbate the problem by failing to recognize, as Thomas and Turner point out, that there are many styles with different standards.The book is divided into four parts. The first, \"Principles of Classic Style,\" defines the style and contrasts it with a number of others. \"The Museum\" is a guided tour through examples of writing, both exquisite and execrable. \"The Studio,\" new to this edition, presents a series of structured exercises. Finally, \"Further Readings in Classic Prose\" offers a list of additional examples drawn from a range of times, places, and subjects. A companion website, classicprose.com, offers supplementary examples, exhibits, and commentary, and features a selection of pieces written by students in courses that used Clear and Simple as the Truth as a textbook.",

            "description": "A keen typographic eye may help students and professionals in any creative industry. The Anatomy of Type (in the UK, The Geometry of Type) is all about looking at letters more attentively. You'll discover how to discern between related fonts and how letterform qualities (such as contrast, intricacy, and proportion) impact the mood, readability, and utility of each design through visual diagrams and practical descriptions. Aside from the nutritional content, the large-type spreads are also pleasing to the appearance.The author hand-selected the book's 100 fonts for their practicality and stylistic relevance in today's design world. You'll find current typefaces that are less prevalent \u2014 and frequently more helpful \u2014 than the overused classics, such as Garamond, Bodoni, Gill Sans, and Helvetica, among others.",

            "description": "Sir Ebenezer Howard (1850-1928) was a prominent British urban planner. He travelled to America from England at the age of 21, moved to Nebraska, and soon discovered that he was not meant to be a farmer. By 1876 he was back in England, where he found a job with Hansard, which produces the official verbatim record of Parliament, and he spent the rest of his life in this occupation. Howard read widely, including Edward Bellamy's 1888 utopian novel Looking Backward and thought deeply about social issues. One result was his book To-Morrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform (1898), which was reprinted in 1902 as Garden Cities of To-morrow.This book offered a vision of towns free of slums and enjoying the benefits of both town (such as opportunity, amusement and high wages) and country (such as beauty, fresh air and low rents). He illustrated the idea with his famous Three Magnets diagram which addressed the question 'Where will the people go? ', the choices being 'Town', 'Country' or 'Town-Country' - the Three Magnets. In 1899 he founded the Garden Cities Association, now known as the Town and Country Planning Association and the oldest environmental charity in England.",

            "description": "Best-selling brand expert Marty Neumeier shows you how to make the leap from a company-driven past to the consumer-driven future. You\u2019ll learn how to flip your brand from offering products to offering meaning, from value protection to value creation, from cost-based pricing to relationship pricing, from market segments to brand tribes, and from customer satisfaction to customer empowerment.In the 13 years since Neumeier wrote The Brand Gap, the influence of social media has proven his core theory: \u201cA brand isn\u2019t what you say it isit\u2019s what they say it is.\u201d People are no longer consumers or market segments or tiny blips in big data. They don\u2019t buy brands. They join brands. They want a vote in what gets produced and how it gets delivered. They\u2019re willing to roll up their sleeves and help outnot only by promoting the brand to their friends, but by contributing content, volunteering ideas, and even selling products or services.At the center of the book is the Brand Commitment Matrix, a simple tool for organizing the six primary components of a brand. Your brand community is your tribe. How will you lead it?",

            "description": "Craftsmanship, says Richard Sennett, names the basic human impulse to do a job well for its own sake, and good craftsmanship involves developing skills and focusing on the work rather than ourselves. The computer programmer, the doctor, the artist, and even the parent and citizen all engage in a craftsman\u2019s work. In this thought-provoking book, Sennett explores the work of craftsmen past and present, identifies deep connections between material consciousness and ethical values, and challenges received ideas about what constitutes good work in today\u2019s world.\u200dThe Craftsman engages the many dimensions of skill\u2014from the technical demands to the obsessive energy required to do good work. Craftsmanship leads Sennett across time and space, from ancient Roman brickmakers to Renaissance goldsmiths to the printing presses of Enlightenment Paris and the factories of industrial London; in the modern world he explores what experiences of good work are shared by computer programmers, nurses and doctors, musicians, glassblowers, and cooks. Unique in the scope of his thinking, Sennett expands previous notions of crafts and craftsmen and apprises us of the surprising extent to which we can learn about ourselves through the labor of making physical things.",

Service Design has become somewhat of a buzzword in recent years, attracting a lot of attention from a variety of industries. This book was put together using the same co-creative and user-centered methodologies that you can read and learn about within to define and demonstrate the developing topic of service design. The lines between goods and services are blurring, and it's time to consider a new approach: service design thinking.To create this book, a group of 23 international authors and even more online contributors from the global service design community pooled their knowledge, experience, and passion. It presents service design thinking in a way that is understandable to novices and students, broadens knowledge, and can be used as a resource by experienced designers.",

            "description": "Available again, the enduring, iconic volume showcasing the key early-career work and process of the godfather of modern graphic design.Milton Glaser: Graphic Design, perhaps the most famous book of its kind, explores the early decades of America\u2019s pre-eminent graphic artist. Glaser\u2019s work ranges from the psychedelic Bob Dylan poster to book and record covers; from store and restaurant design to toy creations; and magazine formats including New York magazine and logotypes, all of which define the look of our time. Here Glaser undertakes not only a remarkably wide-ranging representation of his oeuvre from the incredibly fertile early years, but, in a new introduction, speaks of the influences on his work, the responsibilities of the artist, the hierarchies of the traditional art world, and the role of graphic design in the area of his creative growth. First published in 1973, Milton Glaser: Graphic Design is an extraordinary achievement and indisputably a classic in the field.",

            "description": "By the time Goethe's \"Theory of Colours\" appeared in 1810, the wavelength theory of light and color had been firmly established. To Goethe, the theory was the result of mistaking an incidental result for an elemental principle. Far from pretending to a knowledge of physics, he insisted that such knowledge was an actual hindrance to understanding. He based his conclusions exclusively upon exhaustive personal observation of the phenomena of color.Of his own theory, Goethe was supremely confident: \"From the philosopher, we believe we merit thanks for having traced the phenomena of colours to their first sources, to the circumstances under which they appear and are, and beyond which no further explanation respecting them is possible.\"Goethe's scientific conclusions have, of course, long since been thoroughly demolished, but the intelligent reader of today may enjoy this work on quite different grounds: for the beauty and sweep of his conjectures regarding the connection between color and philosophical ideas; for an insight into early nineteenth-century beliefs and modes of thought; and for the flavor of life in Europe just after the American and French Revolutions.The work may also be read as an accurate guide to the study of color phenomena. Goethe's conclusions have been repudiated, but no one quarrels with his reporting of the facts to be observed. With simple objects -- vessels, prisms, lenses, and the like -- the reader will be led through a demonstration course not only in subjectively produced colors, but also in the observable physical phenomena of color. By closely following Goethe's explanations of the color phenomena, the reader may become so divorced from the wavelength theory -- Goethe never even mentions it -- that he may begin to think about color theory relatively unhampered by prejudice, ancient or modern.",

When you make the transition from maker to manager, you give ownership of projects to your team even though you could do them yourself better and faster. You're juggling expectations from your manager, who wants consistent, predictable output from an inherently unpredictable creative process. And you're managing the pushback from your team of brilliant, headstrong, and possibly overqualified creatives.Leading talented, creative people requires a different skill set than the one many management books offer. As a consultant to creative companies, Todd Henry knows firsthand what prevents creative leaders from guiding their teams to success, and in Herding Tigers he provides a bold new blueprint to help you be the leader your team needs. Learn to lead by influence instead of control. Discover how to create a stable culture that empowers your team to take bold creative risks. And learn how to fight to protect the time, energy, and resources they need to do their best work.Full of stories and practical advice, Herding Tigers will give you the confidence and the skills to foster an environment where clients, management, and employees have a product they can be proud of and a process that works.",

            "description": "A globe-trotting, eye-opening exploration of how cities can\u2015and do\u2015make us happier people.Charles Montgomery's Happy City is revolutionizing the way we think about urban life.After decades of unchecked sprawl, more people than ever are moving back to the city. Dense urban living has been prescribed as a panacea for the environmental and resource crises of our time. But is it better or worse for our happiness? Are subways, sidewalks, and condo towers an improvement on the car dependence of the suburbs?The award-winning journalist Charles Montgomery finds answers to such questions at the intersection between urban design and the emerging science of happiness, during an exhilarating journey through some of the world's most dynamic cities. He meets the visionary mayor who introduced a \"sexy\" bus to ease status anxiety in Bogot\u00e1; the architect who brought the lessons of medieval Tuscan hill towns to modern-day New York City; the activist who turned Paris's urban freeways into beaches; and an army of American suburbanites who have hacked the design of their own streets and neighborhoods.Rich with new insights from psychology, neuroscience, and Montgomery's own urban experiments, Happy City reveals how cities can shape our thoughts as well as our behavior. The message is ultimately as surprising as it is hopeful: by retrofitting cities and our own lives for happiness, we can tackle the urgent challenges of our age. The happy city can save the world\u2015and we can all help build it.",

This book examines how human behavior can be used to integrate your product design into lifestyle, rather than interrupt it, and make decisions for the good of those that are using your product.Mindful Design introduces the areas of brain science that matter to designers, and passionately explains how those areas affect each human\u2019s day-to-day experiences with products and interfaces. You will learn about the neurological aspects and limitations of human vision and perception; about our attachment to harmony and dissonance, such as visual harmony, musical harmony; and about our brain\u2019s propensity towards pattern recognition and how we perceive the world cognitively.In the second half of the book you will focus on the practical application of what you have learned, specific to interaction and interface design. Real-world examples are used throughout so that you can really see how design is impacting our everyday digital experience.Design is a responsibility, but not enough designers understand the human mind or the process of thought. This book explores the key factors involved and shows you how to make the right design choices.",

The antithesis to sites that cater to all tastes, Remodelista has a singular and clearly defined aesthetic: classic pieces trump designs that are trendy and transient, and well-edited spaces take precedence over cluttered environments. High and low mix seamlessly here, and getting the look need not be expensive (think Design Within Reach meets Ikea). Remodelista decodes the secrets to achieving this aesthetic, with in-depth tours and lessons from 12 enviable homes; a recipe-like breakdown of the hardest-working kitchens and baths; dozens of do-it-yourself projects; The Remodelista 100, a guide to the best everyday household objects; and an in-depth look at the ins and outs of the remodeling process. In a world of design confusion, Remodelista takes the guesswork out of the process.",

This collection presents fifty large-scale artworks from the American master's color field period (1949\u20131970) alongside essays by Rothko's son, Christopher Rothko, and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art curator of painting and sculpture Janet Bishop. Featuring illuminating details about Rothko's life, influences, and legacy, and brimming with the emotional power and expressive color of his groundbreaking canvases, this essential volume brings the renowned artist's luminous work to light for both longtime Rothko fans and those discovering his work for the very first time. A textured case and large-scale tip-on on the front cover round out this sumptious package.",

            "description": "Michael Johnson is a top graphic designer and brand consultant in the globe. Johnson Banks, his studio, has rebranded a number of well-known clients, including Virgin Atlantic, Think London, BFI, Christian Aid, and MORE TH>N, and has won several accolades in the process.In Branding, Johnson breaks down daily brands into their most basic components, using case studies to help us understand why we choose one product or service over another, as well as how seemingly little factors may impact major life decisions. The first section of the book demonstrates how the creation of a brand begins with recognizing the proper question\u2014the missing gap in the market\u2014to which a response is required, rather than with finding a solution. From the strapline, which provides the brand a narrative and a purpose, through smart typographic applications that link design and language, Johnson proceeds to reveal hidden factors involved in developing a great brand.Branding explores every step of the development process required to create the simplest and most immediately compelling brands, with over 1,000 vibrant illustrations showcasing the world's most successful corporate identities, as well as generic templates enabling you to create your own brand or ad with ease.",

Most people spend over eight hours a day staring at a screen, and some \u201ctechnological innovators\u201d are hoping to grab even more of your eyeball time. You have screens in your pocket, in your car, on your appliances, and maybe even on your face. Average smartphone users check their phones 150 times a day, responding to the addictive buzz of Facebook or emails or Twitter.Are you sick? There\u2019s an app for that! Need to pray? There\u2019s an app for that! Dead? Well, there\u2019s an app for that, too! And most apps are intentionally addictive distractions that end up taking our attention away from things like family, friends, sleep, and oncoming traffic.There\u2019s a better way.In this book, innovator Golden Krishna challenges our world of nagging, screen-based bondage, and shows how we can build a technologically advanced world without digital interfaces.In his insightful, raw, and often hilarious criticism, Golden reveals fascinating ways to think beyond screens using three principles that lead to more meaningful innovation. Whether you\u2019re working in technology, or just wary of a gadget-filled future, you\u2019ll be enlightened and entertained while discovering that the best interface is no interface.",

Featuring hundreds of powerful art works in 60 cities \u2013 from Albuquerque to Boston and Baja to Rio de Janeiro \u2013 the book is both an informative guide and a virtual bucket list of outstanding art destinations.Conceived and developed by Phaidon editors, Art & Place covers carving, painting, murals, frescos, earthworks, land art, and more. Each of the works has a dedicated entry pairing gorgeous, large-format images with in&hyphen;depth descriptions. Maps pinpoint the sites\u2019 locations while specially commissioned plans reveal some of the more complex layouts. The book is organized geographically, offering fresh juxtapositions among familiar art works, such as Anish Kapoor\u2019s Cloud Gate and Robert Smithson\u2019s Spiral Jetty, alongside lesser-known revelations, such as Inhotim Centro de Arte Contempor\u00e2nea in Brazil. Whether in the mountains, at the heart of a city, or on a remote island, the works in Art & Place are all inextricably linked with their environment. This is art to experience in an immersive way, presented together in a single book for the first time.",

But by identifying stress cases and designing with compassion, you\u2019ll create experiences that support more of your users, more of the time.Join Sara Wachter-Boettcher and Eric Meyer as they turn examples from more than a dozen sites and services into a set of principles you can apply right now. Whether you\u2019re a designer, developer, content strategist, or anyone who creates user experiences, you\u2019ll gain the practical knowledge to test where your designs might fail (before you ship!), vet new features or interactions against more realistic scenarios, and build a business case for making decisions through a lens of kindness. You can\u2019t know every user, but you can develop inclusive practices that support a wider range of people. This book will show you how.",

Eddie's outlandish fantasies and metafictional tricks convert life into art, while staying fully grounded in his own absurdity.This Life-Size Omnibus edition of ALEC includes all the stories from The King Canute Crowd, Three-Piece Suit, How to be an Artist, and After the Snooter, as well as the very early, out-of-print ALEC stories and a staggering amount of bonus material.",

            "description": "This book is about how type should look and how to make it look that way; in other words, how to set type like a professional. It releases the craft knowledge that used to reside almost exclusively in the heads of people working in type shops. The shops are gone, the technologies have changed, but the goal remains the same. This book explains in very practical terms how to use today's computerized tools to achieve that secret of good design: well-set type.Beautifully designed and richly illustrated, The Complete Manual of Typography is an essential reference for anyone who works with type. Designers, print production professionals, and corporate communications managers can go straight to the index to find focused answers to specific questions, while educators and students can read it as a textbook from cover to cover. You'll find:History, basic concepts, and anatomy of good typography, concisely presented and indexed for quick reference by busy professionals. Straight-ahead instructions for how to manage fonts, handle corrupted or missing fonts, and find the characters you need. Clear, useful explanations of what makes good type good (and bad type bad) . Detailed guidance on controlling the fundamentals of type, including measure, point size, leading, kerning, and hyphenation and justification. Practical advice on how to fix and avoid composition problems such as loose lines, bad rags, widows and orphans. Hard-to-find rules for managing indents and alignments, skews, wraps, expert-set characters, and tables. Scores of workarounds that show how to wring good type out of uncooperative word-processing and layout programs.",

This revision includes the full texts of Part I of the original, on the Las Vegas strip, and Part II, \"Ugly and Ordinary Architecture, or the Decorated Shed,\" a generalization from the findings of the first part on symbolism in architecture and the iconography of urban sprawl. (The final part of the first edition, on the architectural work of the firm Venturi and Rauch, is not included in the revision.)",

            "description": "Big data entrepreneur Allen Gannett overturns the mythology around creative genius, and reveals the science and secrets behind achieving breakout commercial success in any field.\u00a0We have been spoon-fed the notion that creativity is the province of genius -- of those favored, brilliant few whose moments of insight arrive in unpredictable flashes of divine inspiration.\u00a0 And if we are not a genius, we might as well pack it in and give up. Either we have that gift, or we don\u2019t.\u00a0 But Allen shows that simply isn\u2019t true.\u00a0 Recent research has shown that there is a predictable science behind achieving commercial success in any creative endeavor, from writing a popular novel to starting up a successful company to creating an effective marketing campaign.\u00a0\u00a0As the world\u2019s most creative people have discovered, we are enticed by the novel and the familiar. By understanding the mechanics of what Gannett calls \u201cthe creative curve\u201d \u2013 the point of optimal tension between the novel and the familiar \u2013 everyone can better engineer mainstream success.\u00a0\u00a0In a thoroughly entertaining book that describes the stories and insights of everyone from the Broadway team behind Dear Evan Hansen, to the founder of Reddit, from the Chief Content Officer of Netflix to Michelin star chefs, Gannett reveals the four laws of creative success and identifies the common patterns behind their achievement.",
